**Motivation:**

Inspired by the potential of leveraging TED Talks videos for educational and research purposes, I embarked on a project to collect and process TED videos. The goal is to transform video content into text and use advanced models to generate new, insightful video content related to TED Talks. This project aims to enhance the accessibility and usability of TED Talks by converting them into structured text data, which can be further analyzed and used to generate new content.
