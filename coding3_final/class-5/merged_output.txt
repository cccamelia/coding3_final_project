a graphic design teacher named linda weinman and also have an aspiring entrepreneurs decided to get the website linda dot com she did so because she needed a sandbox to play in with the new graphic design tools the digital tools that were being developed at that time photoshop illustrator and many more
and she needed a place to put her students work so all could see it
well she put that website together and the business began to grow and in two thousand two she discovered it could be much much more so she moved to all have her teaching online later the business was sold to linked in who renamed dip linked in learning sold for one point
five billion us dollars
linda is the poster child for what i call the counter conventional mindsets of entrepreneurs
so i went to tell you about these mindsets today and here we go so number one why do i call them countered conventional well first these six mindsets run counter to the best practices as we call them that are done and big companies today they fly in the face of lunch of which we teach
atlanta business school and other business schools a bad strategy about marketing about the risk and about much more now you might say john where do you mean by mindset
a mindset of course is up here right is it it's those things that attitudes habits thoughts mental inclination which when something comes our way pre determined the response we make to that something that comes our way and those something says we entrepreneurs call them are opportunities
is so i want to tell you about these six mindsets and the first one i call yes we can now be school strategy one or one says the following what we're supposed to do and a company is stick to our knitting we've gotta figure what what we're really good at be i'm them core competencies and we've gotta build on them invest in them
nurture them make them more robust and if somebody comes along and says can you do something different it's outside of that what are we supposed to say no i'm sorry we don't do that around here
well
a brazilian entrepreneur a bottle korea dope a wonderful business that today is called admiral digital by disregarding those rules he had already reinvented his business twice to become a major provider of event management and production services when one of his cause
summers said to him you know i have two hundred and sixty stores scattered all around brazil and brazil's the big country and i like to be able to broadcast a trading and motivational events to the stores in real time so arnold could we put televisions in the training room of all my stores and could we build a satellite uplink so
we can send all this wonderful stuff to the stores so what did he say he said yes we can do that even though he knew nothing about satellite technology and never operated outside so so paolo a buddy got it done then several years later some of the other customers one of them in particular walmart said well
jarod it's nice that we have all of these said these television screens in the back room with the store but wouldn't it be cool if we had them on the sales floor because then we could run advertising so when the customer walks down the aisle for detergent perhaps says an after proctor and gamble stuttered of in that i'll and what it arnold say to that request
yes we can do that
over a period of years arnold reinvented his business fundamentally for different times by saying when a customer wanted something new that lay outside his core competencies yes weaker the second well i want to tell you about i call problem first not product for logic so a big companies today
it's all about the products so when i'm in the u s my family and i have used tied for many years to wash our clothes
and there we got a chuckle every now and then because we can tell a new brand manager has come along because what happens they change the product right they take the blues speckles out of it and turn them green and they call it new improved is this innovation guys i'm not so sure
coca cola what it what is there there was a classic coke and then there is no coke that didn't work out too well then there was diet coke and coke zero and vanilla coke and cherry coke lots of coach
i don't think this is what innovation is all about but for entrepreneurs we don't focus on products we focus on problems saw a guy named jonathan thorn developed the technology the did something very useful this instrument you see in front of you is called a surgical for sip
it's the tool that almost every surgeon in any kind of medical discipline uses to do his or her work but there's a problem with these surgical forceps

so
i'm from guatemala
this is a public service announcement that is where one of my last
also that is not where they keep the prisoners and is called one time animal
the same place
so what i'm most right below mexico and for the americans in the audience and let the sink in because it really applies in most ways for the americans in the audience you can think of it as mexico's mexico
just like the us doesn't one illegal immigration from mexico mexico doesn't want to illegal immigration from guatemala
it's a smaller country
it's a poor country
and well what can i tell you how much better mexican food
what am i was it's a very poor country and a lot of people talk about education or something that brings equality to different social classes but i always it has the opposite some them brings inequality
because what happens in practice is that people who have a lot of money and by themselves a really good education and therefore continue having a lot of money whereas people who don't have very much money and they learn how to read and write and therefore never make a lot of money and this is especially true in poor countries
now i was fortunate that i received a rich person's education
even though i didn't grow up rich and it's because i'm an only child
and my mother who was a single mothers and all of our resources on my education
and this allow me to come to college to the u s and eventually get a phd in computer science
now because of all of us
about ten years ago i decided i wanted to do something that would give equal access to education to everyone
and by the way this is what i want to talk to about three given equal access to education to everyone
at the time i was a professor of computer science at carnegie mellon university and i decided to work on this with my phd student summary
the way my brain works olive education is just too general have a problem
so i decided let's start teaching one thing and then i started thinking okay well what should we teach first to teach math mean we both loved math me and my cofounder we both have math and now we we didn't decide to do math then we fighting and well maybe you should teach computer science
but eventually and this may be surprising that people in north america eventually we decided that the best subject to start with was teaching foreign languages
and let me tell you why is a number of reasons i'm one of them is that there's a huge audience for it is a two billion people in the world earning a foreign language of in school and outside of schools most of these people went away i learning english about eighty percent of them are learning english and this weird map i hear all the countries in green a countries in which people are pretty
dominantly learning english and the reason for that is because english control the transform your life in most countries in the world knowledge of english and significantly increase your income potential
so this is another reason why we decided to start with foreign languages and is because you can directly make more money if you'll learn another language in particular english and see this is pretty different than many other subjects for example big math
because of math just knowledge of math does not increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math to then learn physics to them become a civil engineer like that's how you make more money whereas with languages if you are a waiter and you'll learn english now you can be a waiter at a hotel and make more money
so we decided well let's get started teaching languages now we also convinced ourselves that the only way to really reach a lot of people west are using a mobile phone or smartphone in particular
the building schools all over the world is simply too expensive
on the other hand most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone and the trend is that a fraction is only going to increase so we decided that the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone and then we call it duolingo
now in order to truly be accessible to everyone rich and poor duolingo used as a freemium model to support itself
that means is that you can learn as much as you want without ever having to pay
but if you don't pay you may have to see an ad at the end of a lesson
and if you don't like ads you can also paid to describe the turn of the ads
and it turns out that the vast majority of the revenue for duolingo comes from people to pay described to turn of the ass
and now for these people who pay to suspend the turn of the as well they're usually people that well off people in rich countries like the us and canada who are the people who don't pay does as by be usually come from poorer countries like brazil or vietnam or one ammo
what i like about this model is that it is a small form of wealth redistribution because we're basically a rich people to pay for the occasion education of everyone so i like that
it's a great so with smartphones we can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people to pay for the whole thing spread however if you're trying to deliver education with a smartphone you run into a humongous problem
and it is that smartphones comic but with some of the most i forgive drugs to humanity has engineered it doctor instagram mobile games
seat delivering education of our smartphone is like hoping that people will eat your broccoli or right next to it you put the most delicious dessert ever made
if if you really want to deliver education to everyone not only do you have to make it accessible but also you have to make it so that people want to actually learn
and we do willing we've been able to do this and at the highest level the where we've done this is by making the broccoli there's like desert
i say it another way what we've done is that we've used the same psychological techniques that
apps like instagram up or mobile games used to keep people engaged in this case we use them to keep you engaged with education
and even some examples of these techniques one of the most powerful ones is the notion of a streak what a streak is is is just a counter measures a number of days that you've used the proud of consecutive you just think that number you put a very prominently in your product and then people come back every day and the reason people come back every day is because
well if they don't come back that number reset to zero and people don't want to lose district
it works
now on the one side streets have been criticised for for example getting teens addicted to snap chat but in the case of an educational map
three get people to come back to study everyday
not to give you an idea of the power of streaks in the case of duolingo we have over three million daily active users and have a streak longer than three hundred and sixty five
that means they haven't missed the day in the last year or longer now on fact about streaks one country to getting has the longest average streets
for an educational app
it's pam
of course
shortest that restricts
latin america maybe
oh what fun a were fun
another important mechanism to get people to come back to your product or notifications on the ones i notifications can be released on the and annoying but in the case of an educational product you will actually want to be reminded to learn and because of duolingo we have a very sophisticated ai system
that basically choose this when to send the notification and also what to say in his notification to maximize the probability that people come back
now interestingly even after all the sophistication it turns out that the algorithm for choosing what i'm to send your notification is pretty simple
you know what is the best time to send people a notification i'll tell you it's twenty four hours after they use the brought up last
because and there's an easy explanation if you are free yesterday at three pm you probably street today after be i'm as well
and so this is what a very sophisticated millions of dollars of a i found
funny
now with notifications you shouldn't be spam and we're not spamming with duolingo actually stop sending notifications after seven days of and activities of you don't use duolingo for seven days we stopped and the you notifications not some point it occurred to us if we're stopping the send people don't have a good as we should let them know so i we started sending this notification two people saying it is a reminder
seem to be working with stop sending them for now you know people do when they get this notification
they come back
passive aggressive
worst for my mother works for developing a
passive aggressive not i guess it's a really good up getting people to come back because they feel like are green our mascot has given up on them
so they come back and speaking of a green our mascot by the way because all our notifications come from our green our mascot and well his passive aggressive and also pretty bushy this is given rise to a lot of names on the internet that make fun of just the great lengths that he will go through get you back to learn a language is one of my favorite ones this is it's a meme my favorite ones
basically looks like you forgot your spanish lessons and then there's an intruder lend presumably the al broke into your house to give you learn language
now duolingo has entered the decide guest and this this thousands of means there's some else gets about it and it's because we've managed to get people to want to learn a language by using the same techniques that
mobile games and social media use to get people engaged and
this is a really important point let me say this am
i don't actually believe that there's a way to make an educational app yes engaging something like picked up where instagram or mobile games
but the good news is that and by the way to the reason i don't believe that is because ultimately you have to teach people something and it's hard to compete with like cats and celebrities i'm but the good news is the i don't think you have to so here's the thing when you're learning something you get meaning out of it whereas when you're scrolling for two hours and instagram a lot of times afterwards if
you're lucky you just wasted your time so i think it's actually okay if your educational product is only eighty or ninety percent as engaging or something like ticked off because the other ten or twenty percent will be provided by people's internal motivational though of course not much more than that
this is really a key point if we want to get people to do something
meaningful you can use the same techniques that apps like social media use to get people to do it and even if you're not as engaging as those apps are you can still get hundreds of millions of people to use your product in the case of duolingo for example there are more people learning languages on duolingo in the united states and there are people learning languages across all us high school
combined
and this is true in most countries in the

the lego i love them be back in the eighties in berlin when i grew up and i still love them and these days i pulled lego with my kids on saturday afternoons and the reason that my love for leg or has remained evergreen is quite simply that lego was a system for realizing creativity with almost no barrier
yeah to entry
none not only a lego dad i'm also the see of get up and if you don't know get up you can think of it as the home of coding it's we are all the software developers the cheap learns of our society
collaborate together
and it's part of our mission to make as easy as possible for every developer to build small and big ideas with coat
but in contrast to lego the process of building software fence daunting to most people
this all started to change when church a pity came along and a twenty twenty two now we live in a world that intelligent machines understand as as much as we understand them
all because of language
and this will forever changed the baby crane software
up until now in order to create software you had to be a professional software developer you had to understand speak and interpret the highly complex sometimes nonsensical language of a machine that recall coat
modern code still looks like hieroglyphics to most people he's an example this from the early nineteen forties is the world's first computer programming language cause plant i feel it set the foundation for the modern code that be used to as you can see it's a few numbers some bubbles in some big
as brackets not much humanity here right flash forward about twenty years to the program language quite cobol cobol was invented during the eisenhower years but it remains an important language for many of our largest financial institutions fourth street your savings account your credit
that's all i on this today
we see some familiar roads yeah but structurally i think just doesn't make much sense to most of you flash forward another thirty years to ninety ninety one and be saw the birth of python one of the most popular for gambling bitches in this era of a i
in eighty years we've been fumbles to brackets to blips of english and yet he got nowhere near as close as that intuitiveness of human language
but then came june twenty twenty and because early access to open the eyes large language model then call gpp sweet
it was cool that we were all on lockdown i don't remember even elena video card together be fat and and programming exercise into this all model and like magic it so of ninety percent of them during the first few takes via get up like a nice with something remarkable in our hands and big fifty turned to our
de nada develop a tool called get a copilot an ai assistant the predicts and completes code for software developers copilot is now the most adopted a i develop a tool on the planet
the age of covering has been reborn
at the possibilities of the break from further than just his business reasons
because the largely much more that our church should and copilot trained on a fast my body of human information they understand and interpret nearly every human language have a major human language
seem to get us
we have struck a new fusion between the language of a human and efficient
any human language
with a single of little twat goodbye to the battles and the big as bracket
this is the most profound beg for to technology since the genesis of software development itself
today will one hundred million developers on get have that's about one percent of the world's population you know plus minus i think that number is about to explode and i want to show you why he on memory we started it all with the of it's not pilot a hobby say the oh gee copilot and literally just predicted and computer
code in the editor at he can think of the editor as you know that google docs for developers center when you have an open talk open you know how this empty page what do i want to do and i mentioned lego so let's say let's build a speedy lego brick on a web page so what going up as doing this start typing in size type you know javascript file a a
functional
create a legal by can he can see this great text because this goes tax this is coming from the last with motors now i can just press the tacky and press enter and i get enough suggestion you know to create a lego tall maybe to it later like kinda us to function
lego blake and she again you see goes text from copilot i'd have a available for me and if i like what i'm seeing yes i get into bit of mode of hiding an understanding i can just accept this developers love that right because instead of adding ten lanes of code themselves or copy and pasting them from the internet
that get them right in the editor they can stay in the flow know what the orgy cooper the didn't offer me is invade to interact with this i cannot ask questions i cannot you know instructed to do different things last year be launched a new feature copilot checks and you can think about it this cenci be v added a second open this up in the sidebar
and now i can not tell it to create a whole that page with the sweetie like a week for me now you know similar to you t extremes the response in the gives me not only some code but actually gives me an explanation you know it starts getting code you can see the comments that explains what the code does it uses an open source that really caught three j s nc can kinda see her that
idea of this empowering developers and people that want to learn development and it is and seen over the another explanation i can go here inspector codie can actually push that button to copied into my file i want to show is something else you might have already seen as little make i can so i can use that to speak to copilot and i want to ask it
it in german but that code does that is on the left seven the editor
comes to me actually and is a fake would matt
and now we know copilot response again but it's us in german to me right that says if i lose the translated yes of course the javascript code defines a function names or legal wage so get the idea he has six year old and berlin in in mumbai and real can now it's are putting without their parents being of
and or even having a technical background
i mean you know
now what you also see as you still need to kind of figure out how you put that altogether right there's a lot of technical stuff he i have code have to integrate on my machine and have to figure out how to deploy the to the closet can sort of my friends but i use my leg awake now at this is what it looks like if i've done all these steps as a developer
you can see you know it's a nice they want having great i can actually use my mouse to turn it around these are the enticed that see other states there's no studying effects can even zoom into this out of this now i don't want to do all this developer stuff anymore just one a channel my creativity straight into reality and so for the first time ever on stage via i'm going to show you know
product that because hope hundred bucks space that does exactly that so here's my workspace me can already see that's not an editor anymore i can just see a task and i can enter a task into not have my leg opening i want to know expand the lego break into a lego house
his deck the breaks in the shape of a lego house and i can do that also german in other languages but for now let's stick with english
i can save my task the know what happens is that cooper adverse press analyze what i already have and then describes but it proposes to me busy get the friends my ask into a plan or specification the can see i you know it's all a natural language you know it uses some file names of course but there is no coach he has all describing it innings that can actually go in
to this and edited and can make changes to this line or can go down here and had another item if i feel like the plan is not exactly what i want i can go a step further and generate a plan and now an agent runs pull all my files already has and figure out how to him what need to modify those files or you know twenty two advice to my depositories so not wants to add a
create lego hosts function and a call the create like a hose afterwards looks good to me so let's implement this and now copilot uses my task my specific case mad men code for me you can see as to files acute the public lego blood yes file a boom there's already my code written for me right i didn't have to touch code i didn't have to even
one code is no i see here this you know it import some new line into my father has with you know lots of coach you that that was changes so you want to see what that looks like did you get a like a house
so

i began to observe something in my own behavior that may be a bit
uncomfortable
and that was that from the moment that i woke up to the morning that to to the end of the day my life was a series of screens i started the day with the thing that woke me up first thing in them or morning my phone and so i sat there in bed watching various cooking videos on instagram and bouncing around between a bunch of different apple
occasions but then it was time to get out of bed and cook breakfast and so the thing that i focus then on and in addition to the omelette in the pan was of the i pad that was right next to the oven and then it was time to do some work and so i went to a different screen which was attached to another screen itself all the while this live
all devil and my rest was tapping and beeping and blue being and distracting me as i was trying to get important stuff done
but there was one particular offender out of all of these different devices that i wasted more time on than anything else that was this dastardly thing my phone i can spend hours on this thing every single day and so i decided to essentially
for all intents and purposes get rid of the thing for a month as an experiment i thought i'm going to live on this thing for just thirty minutes every single day at a maximum and so this is the amount of time i have for maps this is the amount of time to call my mother this is the amount of time that i have for everything that i could possibly want to do to listen to music to listen to
the podcast and i observed what happened during this time
it took about a week
to adjust downward into a new lower level of stimulation but once i did i noticed that three curious things began to happen
first my attention spit and group it was like i could focus on things that effortlessly but with much more ease than i could be for this experiment start
in addition to this though as i was going about the world and especially when my mind wandered about i had more ideas
that my mind arrived on and on top of this i had more plans and thoughts about the future
getting rid of one simple device lead to these three effects
why
noticing that is a few years back lead me on this long journey to get to the bottom of what it takes to focus in a world of distraction i pored over hundreds of research papers from front to back of my office i don't have you ever watch well as crime shows where somebody solving
a murder and so they have this big bristol board and their string attached the papers that to memos it has a newspaper good is this is like what the state of the office was i flew out to meet experts around the world who study focused i conducted more experiments on myself and tell the point i had twenty five thousand words of research notes about why this
is the case how does technology influence our attention and our ability to focus
i want to start with the attention spans that we have this is how we pay attention to the world around us and how much control we have over our focus the research around this particular area is fascinating it turns out that when we to work in front of a computer especially when our
phone is nearby we focus on one thing for just forty seconds before we switch to doing something else
and when we have things like slack open as we're doing some work this lowers to the thirty five seconds
but the reason that this is the case is not what we might think after looking at the research we think the problem is that our brains are distracted but after looking at the research to this is what i've come to know as a symptom for the deeper problem which runs was were deeply the root cause
of this distraction it's not that were distracted it's that our brains are over stimulated it's that we crave distraction in the first place our brains love these tiny little nugget serve information and social media an email and these things that we do of course
of the day there's even a mechanism in our mine called the novelty buys by which are mind rewards us with a hit of doping me one of those those wonderful camera pleasure chemicals the same one that we get when we eat in order a whole media pizza from domino's that you know the same one that we get when we make love we get that same stimulate
asian when we check facebook we got this the opening coursing through i'm i'm in so we not only crave distraction from our mind rewards us for seeking out and finding
destruction in the first place
so this is the state of our minds today we're at this hyper stimulated state where we bounced around between these bunch of different objects of attention that are very very stimulating for are mine
and so i thought okay if the phone had this impact on my attention span what if i lowered how stimulated i was even more still and so have this feeling that we experience when we go from being in a state of high stimulation into a state of low stimulation it has a name
that name is color or or them
you know this is restless is that we feel when we have is super busy talking that were lying on the couch on a sunday afternoon thing and
so i challenge time i put on encounter the readers of my life
is the most boring thing that you can think of doing i'm going to make myself board for an hour a day for a month
and so i did so now it's still linux or for cool
i'm upset about from readers to this day day one i read the i tunes terms and conditions for one hour
it's actually shorter and more readable any might think day for i waited on hold with air canada as baggage claims department it's very easy
this is the check if you want to make your support don't call the reservations department called the baggage claim people because you're going to wait for our as if you ever get through it all day nineteen i counted all the zeroes that i could in the first ten thousand digits of pi
the twenty four i watch the clock
dec
check her one hour
and twenty seven other activities this month
she's i still think that but curiously i noticed that the exact same effects as i did during the smartphone experiment
it took about a week for my mind to adjust downward into a new or lower level of stimulation and this maps curious on top of research that shows that it takes our mind about eight days to fully calm down and rest like when we're on vacation as an example or vacations need to be longer than they are today
but i also noticed that my attention span expanded i was able to focus even more effortlessly because
i wasn't surrounded by fewer distractions but my mind was so much less stimulated that it did not seek the distraction in the first place
but the fun part where these ideas and plans that struck me that didn't before and the reason that this is the case is because my mind had a chance to wander more often
there is a great quote that i love that you might be familiar with from jay are talking or he says that not all those who wander are lost
and the exact same thing is true it turns out with regard to our focus with regard to our attention if you think back
two when your best most brilliant ideas strike you you rarely focused on something maybe this morning you are taking a shower
or maybe some morning in the past and then you're mine had a chance to connect several of the constellations of ideas that were swirling around in your mind to create an idea that would never have materialized otherwise if you were focused on something else on your phone
for example
this is a mode especially when we do this deliberately when we deliberately letter my wandered i call this mode scatter focus and the research shows that it lets or mine come up with ideas it lets or my plan because of where our mind wanders to this is fascinating it turns out that when we just let our attention rest
it goes to three main places we think about the past we think about the present and we think about the future but we think about the past less than we might think only about twelve percent of the time and often the time were recalling ideas in these thought wandering episodes
but the president which is a much more productive place to wander we wander to think about the present twenty eight percent of the time and so this is something as simple as you're typing up an email and you can't find a way to phrase something as it's very delicate mean it's political you go and want to another room you go to other
rumor house of the officer solution hits you because you're mine had a chance to approach and product that problem from different directions
but here's the thing our minds wander to think about the future more than the past and the present combined
whenever our mind is wandering we think about the future forty eight percent of the time this is why when we're taking a shower we plan out our entire day even though it hasn't started yet
this is called our minds prospective buyers and it occurs when our mind wanders
if you're good with math or maps and say not in canada anymore these numbers don't add up to and hundreds because the rest of the time or my is don't it's blamed for it doesn't have an idea inside of it that is rooted in

all too often we aim for perfection but never end up doing anything because the stands that we set ourselves and are too high
they're intimidating which stresses out so we delay starting something for we might even as they enter the whole thing altogether
do it badly frees you up to take action
i mean you know how it is so often we want to do something perfectly we can start until it's the perfect time and so we've got all the skills
but this can be daunting and stressful so why not just jump into it just do it however without worrying if it's good or bad
this will make it that much easier to start something and as you're doing it badly to finish it
and when you look back you realize more often than not that actually it's not that bad
the you

what is love seriously enough what is it what is love a verb a noun a universal truth an ideal the common thread of all religions a cult a neurological phenomenon there's no shortage of answers some are all encompassing it conquers all it's all you mean it's
all there is these are all comparisons to have ways of defining it by contrast by saying it's more important than all other things but is it sure love matters more than your standard turkey sandwich but does it matter more than shelter or sanity or an exceptional turkey sandwich
no matter your answer your just ranking it not defining it another challenge to defining love is we often try to do so while falling into it or out of it would you trust someone who just won the lottery to accurately define the concept of currency for i don't know ask a guy to define bears while he's sending them off
or is romance not like winning the lottery or breakups not like bear attacks
bad comparisons that's my point i'm not thinking right because i'm in love so ha
taking a step back or the taking a cold shower whatever love is potentially the most intensely thought about thing in all of human history and despite centuries upon centuries of obsession it still overwhelms us some say it's a feeling a magical emotion a feeling for someone like you've never felt before but feelings are fluid
not very concrete foundation for a definition sometimes you hate the person you love plus come on you felt feelings like it before sort of in miniature your relationships with your family shape your relationships with partners and your love for your partner may be in it's own dynamic relationship healthy or totally weird with the love of your parents in
siblings love is also a set of behaviors we associate with the feeling
holding hands kissing hugging public displays of affection dating marriage having kids or just sex but these loving actions can be subjective or culturally relative you may love or be someone who can't have kids or doesn't want to who believes in marriage but also in divorce who's from a culture where
people don't really date the way we think of dating for who'd just doesn't want to make out on the bus but if love is a thing that we can define and how can it mean opposite things for so many people so maybe loves all just in your head a personal mystery winding through your neural pathways and lighting up please a natural rewards in your nervous system
perhaps these rewards are addictive perhaps love is a temporary or permanent addiction to a person just like a person can be addicted to drugs
i don't mean to be edgy like some pop song evidence shows that chemicals in your brain stimulated by another person can make you develop a had it for that person the person comes to satisfy a physiological craving and you want more but then sometimes slowly or suddenly you don't you fallen out of love become on addicted for a spell what happen
and does one develop a tolerance or hit a limit might have some lovers stay addicted to each other their entire lives perhaps to create new lives to proliferate their species maybe love is just human dna is optimal method for bringing about it's own replication their evolutionary arguments regarding every human mating behavior from how we display ourselves to potential mates
to how we treat each other and relationships to how we raise kids thus some argue that the feeling you think you feel in your soul is just biology's way to make you continue our species nature has selected you to have crushes on hotties just like it makes monkeys have crushes on hot monkeys and biology marches on
but is that all of his or perhaps worse is it just a construct some fake concept we all convince each other to try to live up to for a fake sense of purpose maybe it is a construct but let's be more precise about what a construct is because love is constructed from reality our experiences feelings brain chemistry cultural expectations are
lives and this edifice can be viewed through countless dimensions scientific emotional historical spiritual legal or just person is no two people are the same no to people's love is the same either so in every loving relationship there's a lot to talk about and partners should be open to that
or the relationship probably won't last love is always up for discussion and sure under construction
so if we can't define it that's a good sign it means we're all still making it
wait i didn't mean you know what i meant
dying

the have you here
let's see a festival in oh congratulations you really put off something remarkable on on on that really you achieve second the very few people do which was you pulled off a kind of a bipartisan consensus in us politics was by
it off the bat is was that that consensus largely seem to be we must ban tick tick tock so we're going to come to that and a bit and i'm curious about that before we before we got that we need to know about you
you you seem to me like remarkable has and want to know a bit of your story and how you came to tick tock in the in the first place okay thank you chris but before we do that can i just checked need to know my audience how many of you hear use account
oh thank you for those who donned the wife is free
so that the get another costume which is how many of you here have had your lives touched through tick tock through your kids and other people in your lives
i mean it's it's or there's a great to see if it's basically if you're alive you have had some kind of contact with the ticked off at this point sell tell us about you so my name is show and i'm from singapore
roughly ten years ago i met with some to engineers who are building a product and idea behind this was the buddha product that
recommended content of people not based on who the new which was are you feeling about ten years ago
it was all the social graph was all the rage and do as you know your content and of fee that you saw should be based on people are you knew now been ten years ago these two engineers thought of something different which is instead of showing you what you let you know is that of for showing you people you knew what do we show your content and you'd like
right
and that sort of the genesis and a birth of from you know the early intimations of tick tock and about five years ago with the advent of i'm in a for g short video mobile phone penetration to come was born and a couple years ago you'd i had opportunity to run this company and is still excise be every single day
so i want to dig in a little more into this about what was it that made this take off sex pleasant because that that the language i hear from people who spent time on it it's sort of like i mean it it it it is a different level of addiction to other
media out there and i don't necessarily mean this and that in a good way will be coming onto this good and bad things about this type of addiction but it's the feeling that within a couple days of of experience of ticked up it knows you and it and it surprises you with things that you didn't know you were going to be interested in but you are how is it really just not instead
the social graph one of these algorithms doing the i think to describe this or to begin to answer your question we have to talk about the mission of the company or the mission is to inspire creativity and to bring joy and i think it on missions for companies like ours is really important because you have product managers working on a product everything
all day and they need to have a stock in or something do so to work towards together
now based on this mission our vision is to provide three things door users we want to provide a window to discover and i'll talk about discovery you talked about this in a second we want to give them a canvas to create which is going to be really exciting with new technologies in ai there's gonna help people in a help people create new things
and the final thing is bridges for people to connect so this would have the vision of what we're trying to build know what really makes tickled very unique and very different is the whole discovery engine behind us so the earlier apps that i have a lot of respect for but there were built for different purpose in for example in the era of
search you know there was an app that was built for people who wanted to search things that was eaten took the saudis more easily the serve found and then in the era of social graphs it was about connecting people enough followers not what we have done is that we are based on ah machine learning algorithms were showing people what they like and what this means is
we have given the everyday person a platform to be discovered if you have talent it is very very easy to get discovered on tick tock and i'll just give you one one example of this the biggest create on tick tock is a guy called copy
copy was from senegal he listened italy he was a factory worker
she you know for the longest time didn't even speak in any of his videos but what he did was in the had talent he was funny he had a good expression he had creativity so we kept posting and today he has one hundred and sixty million followers on our platform so every single day we hear stories like that in a businesses people with talent and i think
is very it's very freeing to have a platform where as long as you have talent you going to be hurt and you have the chance to succeed and as well be providing door users
so this is this is the amazing thing to me like we must have a have grown grown up with say network television for were for decades you've had thousands of brilliant creative people calling in the trenches trying to imagine stuff that will be amazing for an audience and none of them ever remotely came up with anything that know
like many of your creators so so the that that these algorithms by just by observing people's behavior what they look like have discovered things that thousands of believe humans never discovered tell me some of the things that it is looking at so obvious things like have some presses like or stay
is on a video for a long time that gives you a clue more like that but is it subject matter what what what did that one of the one of the array of things that you have noticed that you can actually track that the provide useful to lose the i'm going to simplify this a lot but the machine learning the recommendation algorithm is really just math so for example if you
what if you like videos one two three and four and i like videos one two three and five maybe he liked videos one two three and six know what's gonna happen is because we like one two three yeah the same time he's going to be shown four five six and so army and you can thing about this repeated at skill in real time across more than a billion people sp
basically what this is his math in of course you know ai and machine learning has allowed this to be done at a very very big skill and what we have seen the result of this is that he learns the interest signals that people exhibit very quickly and shows you content is really relevant for you
in a very in in a very quick way not so it's for it's a form of collaborative filtering from what you're saying that yes the theory behind it is the is humans a weird people we don't really know there's them but if if we see that one human is interested with an overlap of someone else chances are you know you can you can make use of the other pieces that are in that overlap
humans repertoire to to to feed feed them and they'll be surprised but the reason they like it is because their power also like that it's his pattern recognition based on your interest signals and i think the other thing here is that we don't actually ask you twenty questions on whether you like a piece of content you know what are your interest we don't do that we
built that experience organically into the of experience so you're voting with a thumbs in know by watching a video you know by citing it by liking it by sharing it you're basically exhibiting interest signals and what it does and a medically is a take those signals put in a formula and a matches it through pattern recognition that's basically the
idea behind it
i mean lots of
startups have tried to use these these types of techniques i'm wondering what else played a role early on him and how how big a deal was a the from the get go you optimizing for smartphones so the videos was shot in for correct format and and they and they were short was that it was that an early distinguishing thing that mattered i think we would have first the really tried
this scale you know the recommendation algorithm is a very important reason as to why the the perform is so popular occur among so many people are beyond that you mention
the format of itself so we talked about the vision of the company which has to have a window to discover in if you sort of just up for the first time you see to it takes up your screen so does the window that we want you can imagine a lot of people using that window to discover new things in their lives then you know through this recommendation algorithm we have found it
it connects people together people find communities and i've heard so many stories of people were found their communities because of the contended a posting now give you an example of
i was in dc recently and i met with a bunch of creators i heard
and so one of them are sitting next to me at a dinner his name is samuel he was a restaurant in phoenix arizona and is a taco restaurant he told me he's never done this before first you know venture
she started posting on this content on tick tock end up you know i saw his content in looks of i was hungry after looking at it's is great you know content in his generators so much interest in his business the last year he mean something like a million dollars in revenue
just via tick tock one restaurant and in again and again a huge his stories by connecting people together by giving people the window to discover we have forgiven many small businesses and many people your common person a voice that it would never otherwise have and i think that's the power of the platform
so you definitely have identified early just how in our social creatures we need affirmation i'm i've had a story and you can tell me whether true or not the one of the keys to your early lift off was that you want to persuade creators who are trying out tick tock that this was a platform where you know they would get whisper
early on when you're trying to grow something in the numbers on that response so you had a brilliant idea of goosing those numbers a bit basically finding ways to give people you know a big a sense of lot more likes more engagement and was actually the case by using a i agent somehow in the in the process is is a brilliant idea is that are the
just a myth i would
i would i would describe it in a different way so the other platforms to exist they don't with before tick tock in if you think about this platforms you sort of have to be famous already in order to go followers because the we is build is that people come and follow people and if we don't if you aren't really famous the chances that you get discovered a very
every law now what we have done again because of the difference in the we were recommended content is that we have given any one any single person with enough talent a speech to be able to be discovered in i think that actually is the single probably the most important thing contributing to the growth of the platform and again and again you will hear stories
from people who use the platform or post regularly on it that if the have something you want to see the performed just them the chance and the stage to connect with the audience in a way that i think no other products in the past as ever offered them
so i'm i'm just trying to play back what what use what you said they you said you were describing their differ way what i what i said is is it that in the case that like to give someone a decent chance someone who's brilliant but doesn't come with any follow as initially that you you have you got some technique to identify talent and that you will you will almost encourage them you will you will give them some guy
and of from artificially increase the number of followers were like so whatever that they have so the others are encouraged to go wow there's something there and so forth like it's this idea of critical mass that kind of every entrepreneur every party planner kind of those about of the know this is the hot place in town everyone calm and that that is how you actually game critical mass we we wanted
sure that every person who posts a video is given and an equal chance to be able to have some audience to begin with but this idea that you are the media alluding to that we can get people to like something it doesn't really work like that you don't then you get could you get a i agents to like something for you see the network way
with extra and for could kind of get you know give give someone early encouragement ultimately what the machine does is he recognizes people's interests so if you post something that's not interesting though a lot of people even if you gave it a lot of exposure you're not going to get of morality that you what whereas come so is is a lot of you know there's no
there's no push your you know it's not like you can go and push something and because i like chris huhne on going to push your content and doesn't work like that you got to have a message to residents are people and if it does then he will automatically just have to borrow the itself that's the beauty of user generated content it's is not something that can be engineered oh
over thought it'd be really is something the has to resonate with the audience and if it does then he goes viral know speaking privately with with investor who knows your company quite quite well
who who said that actually the that the the level of sophistication of the algorithms you have going is is just another order of magnitude to up competitors like you know facebook

this i did play basketball yeah
i remember the exact day and place my entire life change and i didn't even know it
it's april twenty sixth and i'm eighteen years old i'm in the gym
i'm listening to a podcast as i usually do and i work out
and i heard the podcast guest in my ear say something i'd heard so many of these thirty to sixty something psychologists activists authors and business leaders say many times before
if i have the same mindset now that i did in my teens or twenties i be miserable i was such an idiot
i remember every time i heard those statements express with a laugh
it made me feel
sad i was entering college i didn't want to be miserable and then he folds
actually pretty irritated i refused to be miserable much this refusal of misery had to do with that just five months earlier i had sat hand in hand with my dad as he passed away after a six year battle with the terminal disease ls
following that experience i promised myself i would not spend a moment of my life hating it
as i learned that time is never promised
my irritation intensified as i reflected on the fact that that these personal development leaders are rarely talking to young people specifically distant make any sense to me because i thought aren't we the ones that need to know the stuff about growth mindfulness and emotions the most over the next decade i was supposed to
determine a field of study your career potentially find a life partner decide where to live handle personal finances and retirements maybe even start a family and many other decisions that have life long impacts but here i was with thousands of other high school seniors receiving the same
piece of advice from most of the adults and our lives
you've got time
you'll figure it out
i just don't think you need to worry about it
and although this advice is slightly anxiety reducing in the moment we are rarely if ever given practical emotional and decision making training making the anxiety reducing moments extremely short and fleeting because we didn't know how to navigate these decisions we had to make and so
with the all have moment in the gym i found my mission to change the rhetoric of what your teens and twenties could and should be
which brings me to today
and after a bit more study it turns out teenage live he had some very valid points to points in specific down to a neurological level how we train our brains now in our twenties truly matters when it comes to setting ourselves up for a less stressful
more and more fulfilling life
your brain is a complex system of neurological pathways you can think of it like a complex system of roads the more you drive specific routes the more ingrained those habits and behavioral patterns become and that is why it's so important we start specifically choosing which routes
we continue to drive down now because it will be much more painful and difficult to rewire your mind thirty years from now when your mental software has become hardware
and point number to tunisia libya was also onto the fact that the decisions we make in our twenties do matter
but that is why we need and proper emotional and mental skills to help guide us in those decisions make j p h d clinical psychologist nose in her newly revised book the defining decade these statistics that might shake up any young adult a bit
eighty five percent of life's most defining moments happened before age thirty five not the most important not the best moments but life define or is are often happening before your mid thirties
your twenties coincide with your peak childbearing years or than fifty percent of us will be living with a dating or married to our life partner by age thirty you're earning power is generally decided in your first ten years of work and as you probably know in your childhood that's where you will have peak brain development
it but your personality and your brain changes more in your twenties than any time before or after
these statistics show us that the decisions you make in your twenties do in fact matter but to any young adult listening i do want to note these are statistics correlation does not always mean causation but still whether we like it or not we do have some big decisions to make over
the next decade let's dig even deeper
we are humans not statistics as i mentioned so instead of going to google i went to humans to create my own type of study on the matter i spent my career thus far talking to today's teens and twenty somethings about what they actually need to feel
more prepared for their life
i wrote a book answering their questions i started a podcast educating them on the topics that their parents were the education system generally weren't teaching them
i created an online platform reaching millions of them worldwide and i stand here today being a physical representation of what is often represented as a statistic where or teens and twenty somethings struggling most
the common thread did not have to do with being addicted to their phones it didn't have to do with being bullied by their peers are being overly stressed about school or work the common thread was much more conclusive
a feeling of being constantly at war with their minds
but it's not the twenty first century that is the culprit of this mental mass distress is that historically we have rarely if ever put any true emphasis on the development of emotional and decision making skills we need
change
or young adults or children or parents raising our children and young adults need better mental and emotional skills to better create a future for themselves their families their communities and society at large what is going on inside of a
each of us creates the reality of what is happening outside of each of us
these emotional skills
these are not what we call soft skills
these are life changing life saving society altering skills
so how do we make this change well it turns out changing the way society functions on a mass scale is a little bit difficult which you know is probably not very shocking but still with my work with young people over the years i have found
three core pillars of information that can help young people have a simple foundation of better emotional intelligence better decision making skills and empathetic self guided growth which brings us to pillar number one
on learning
there are many unhelpful social constructs that way down today's youth
being the great on your paper determines your intelligence or you're supposed to be nothing but young and dumb right now or my personal favorite this needs to be the best time of your life
so annoying
but the most harmful of all is the way many of us are socially conditioned to determine what a happy and successful life looks like and how to actually achieve it
my dad was a very money driven man carrying a very money driven and as his daughter i inherited a lot of that money driven energy the idea that if i just made enough money that's where i would find peace but for years i watch that same mindset
tear him apart absolutely destroying his ability to have peace
and i didn't want that
so i ask myself okay if i can't determine the success of my life based off of money or status howard net worth how do i determine that i'm living a successful life how do i gauge it
i contemplated that question for a really long time until i found on answer
living in alignment
living in alignment is aligning your core priorities
your actions and your thoughts with your deepest core values
so in your head hits the pillow at night and you can ask yourself am i living as aligned as i can in this moment
and you can truthfully answer that question with yes
that is what peace feels like
because there's nothing more to long for with that mindset the only person that is in charge of your success is you

i had just driven home it was around midnight and the dead of montreal winter i'd been visiting my friend jeff across town and the thermometer on the front porch read minus forty degrees
and don't bother asking if that celsius or fahrenheit minus forty is where the to scales meet and it was very cold and as i stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets i found i didn't have my keys
in fact i could see them through the window lying on the dining room table where i had left them so i quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows and they were locked tight i thought about calling a locksmith at least i had my cell phone but at midnight it could take a while for a locksmith the show up and it was cold
i couldn't go back to my friend just house for the night because i had an early flight to your of the next morning and i needed to get my passport my suitcase
so desperate and freezing cold i found a large rock and i broke through the basement window cleared out the shards of glass i crawled through i found a piece of cardboard and tapes it up over the whole opening figuring that in the morning on the way to the airport i could call my contractor and ask him to to fix it this was going to be expensive but probably
no more expensive than the middle of the night locksmith so i figured under the circumstances i was coming out even
now i'm a neuroscientist by training and i know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress it releases cortisol that raises your heart rate it a modulator adrenaline levels and it clouds you thinking
so the next morning
when i woke up on too little sleep worrying about the whole in the window and a mental note that i had to call my contractor in the freezing temperatures and the meetings i had up coming in europe and your with all the cortisol in my brain my thinking was cloudy but i didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloud
three and
it wasn't until i got to the airport check in counter that i realized i didn't have my passport
so i raised home in the snow and ice forty minutes got my passport raced back to the airport i made it just in time but they'd given away my seat to someone else so i got stuck in the back of the play next to the bathrooms in a seat that wouldn't recline on an eight hour flight
well i had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep
and i started wondering are the things that i can do systems that i can put into place it'll prevent bad things from happening or at least a bad things happen will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe
so i started thinking about that but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later i was having dinner with my colleague danny condom in the nobel prize winner and i somewhat embarrassed bleed told him about having broken my window and you know forgot my passport and danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight
if it's something that he had gotten from the psychologist gary klein who had written about it a few years before also called the pre mortem now you all know what the postmortem is whenever there's a disaster of your team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong right well in the pre mortem danny explain you look at
head you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening or to minimize the damage so what i want to talk to about city or some other things we can do in the form of a pre mortem some of them are obvious some of them are not so obvious i'll start with the og of
yes ones around the home designate a place for things that are easily lost now this sounds like common sense it it is but there's a lot of science to back this up based on the way our spatial memory works there is a structure in the brain called the hippocampus that evolved over time
tens of thousands of years to keep track of the locations of important things where the well as were fish can be found that stand of fruit trees
where the friendly an enemy tribes live the hippocampus is the part of the brain that in london taxi cab drivers becomes enlarged it's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts and if you're wondering somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels and they could still find they're not they weren't using so
smell they were using the hippocampus this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things but it's really good for things that don't move around much not so good for things that move around so this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports so in the home designated spot for your
keys are hooked by the door maybe a decorative bowl for your passport a particular drawer for your reading glasses a particular table if you designate a spot and your scrupulous about it you things will always be there when you look for what about travel take a cell phone picture of your credit cards your driver's license your passport
mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud if these things are lost or stolen you can facilitate replacement out these are some rather obvious things
remember when you're under stress the brain releases cortisol cortisol as toxic and it causes cloudy thinking so part of the practice of the pre mortem is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best and you should put systems in place at there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're confronted
with a medical decision to me and at some point all of us are going to be in that position where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one to help them with the decision as i want to talk about that and i'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition but the stands as a proxy for all kinds of medic
cool decision making and indeed for financial decision making and social decision making any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts so suppose you go to your doctor in the doctor says i just got your blab work back your cholesterol is a little high
now you all know the cholesterol is high cholesterol is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease heart attack stroke and so you thinking having high cholesterol isn't the best thing and so the doctor says you know i'd like to give you a drug it'll help you lower your cholesterol a stack and you probably heard of stat and you know that they're among
the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today you probably even know people who take them and so you think and yeah give me the stat
but there's a question you should ask at this point a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don't like talking about and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less
it's for the number needed to treat
and what is this the an empty it's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo surgery or any medical procedure before one person has helped
and you thinking what kind of crazy statistic is that like the number should be one my doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me if it's not going to help but actually medical practice doesn't work that way and is not the doctors fault if if anybody's fault it's the fault of scientists like me we haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough but glaxo smithkline estimates that now
ninety percent of the drugs work in only thirty to fifty percent of the people so the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed staten what do you suppose it is
how many people have to take it before one person's helped three hundred
this is according to research by research practitioners jerome groopman and pamela hurts span independently confirmed by bloomberg dot com i ran through the numbers myself
three hundred people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack stroke or other adverse event is prevented now you're probably thinking well okay one in three hundred chance of lowering my cholesterol why not doc give gimme the prescription anyway but you should ask if this point for another statistic and that is tell me about the side effects right so for this but
ticket or drug the side effects occur in five percent of the patience and they include terrible things debilitating muscle and joint pain gastrointestinal distress but now you're thinking well five percent not very likely it's going to happen to me i'll still take the drug but wait a minute member under stress we're not thinking clearly so think about how you a work through this ahead
at times you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot three hundred people take the drug right one person's helped five percent of those three hundred have side effects that's fifteen people

then it seems like it should be
actually feeling alive
and when i mean by that is that we all constantly doing release were constantly scrolling
but we're not necessarily living you know we keep ourselves busy to the point of exhaustion or were also languishing in feel a little bit that inside
i think we know that on some level i think that's part of the reason we keep ourselves so busy and distracted to begin with but we don't know what to do about it
so i am here to tell you i figured out what to do about it
we need to have more fun
so you might think that you're already having plenty of fun and that's because in our everyday speech we often use the word fun to describe anything we do have our leisure time even if it's not actually enjoyable and in fact a waste of time servers
so for example we scroll through social media for fun even though doing so often makes us feel bad about like kind of everything or will say there was so fun we should do that again soon and respect
in response to things they worried that fun and that we don't want to do again
ever
but it's not really our father were a little bit sloppy about how we use the word fun because even the dictionary doesn't get a quite right you know it says that fine as an amusement or enjoyment or light hearted pleasure it's a me for kids to have him play areas it makes it sound like it's frivolous and optional
but if you think back on your own memories that stand out to you as having truly been fine and i really encourage you to do this year the memories that you would describe as and forgive me for i scientific terminology so fun
you're going to notice that there's something much deeper going on
i've collected thousands of these stories from people all around the world and i can tell you it's amazing because when people were count the memories in which they had the most fun
they tell you about some of the most joyful and treasured memories of their lives
so in reality fun is not just light hearted pleasure
it's not just for kids and it is definitely not frivolous instead fun as the secrets of feeling alive
so today i want to propose to a new more precise definition of what fun is i want to reveal some of the ways in which it is astonishingly good for us
and want to give you all some suggestions for things you can do starting right now to experience it's power for yourself
so the first thing we need to start with i am is the fact that fun is a feeling and it's not an activity and it's important because a lotta times when i ask people what's fun though respond with a list of activities that they enjoyed you know the same dancing is fun or scheme as finer i don't know pickle ball is fine
everyone seems to think that pickle ball is fun
and assure people can be fun but we've all had experiences were something's off and an activity that seems like it would be fun doesn't end up feeling fun
and then on the flipside we've had experiences were something that doesn't seem like would be fun at all and the feeling ridiculously fun is an element of serendipity it when people do have fun when they experienced this feeling it's actually very easy to recognize because people who are having fun look like they're being illuminated from within
so for example here's me and my husband having fun together
here's some president's having fun together
here's archbishop desmond tutu and the dalai lama having fun together
actually those to seem like they were very often even constantly
having fun together
and as you can see in these photographs true fun produces this visceral sense of lightness and joy
it's radiant and fact when i asked my daughter when she was about five years old what color fun would be she said sunshine
so what is the sunshine you know what is this feeling that we call fun but when people tell me their stories about fun it's really interesting because the details are all different and often quite mundane but the energy running through them as the same and there are three factors that are consistently present to the point that i believe they constitute a new definition one that is a lot more
accurate than what's in the dictionary and those three factors are playfulness connection and flow
so by playfulness i do not mean you have to play games or god forbid make believe i just me having a light hearted attitude of doing things for the sake of doing them and not carrying too much about the outcome letting go of perfectionism when we have fun or guard is down and we're not taking ourselves too seriously
connection or for the feeling of having a special shared experience and i do think it's possible in some circumstances to have fun alone and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings are the activity but the majority of stories of people tell me about their peak fond memories another person is involved and that's true even for interviews
it's
and then flow is the state where we are so engaged and focused on whatever we're doing that we can even lose track of time you can think about an athlete little the game or like a musician plane a piece of music it's when we're in the zone
is possible to be in flow and not have fun like if you're arguing but you cannot have fun if you're not in flow
so playful is cash inflow all feel great on their own but when we experience all three at once something magical happens we have fun
and that doesn't just feel good it is good for us and fact fund us so many amazingly good things for us that i personally believe that fun is not just the result of human thriving it's a cause
so for example fun is energizing
when people tell me their stories about fun they glow it is like a fire has been lit inside of them in the energy and the warmth of they give off is contagious
you know so much of life drains us but fun fills us up
fun also makes us present a lot of us put a lotta work and a trying to be more present you know we do yoga classes we meditate and that is all great or the fact that fun as a flow state means that when we're having fun we simply are present there's no other way for to happen
fun also unites us we live in a really polar as worlds and as we whole know there's a lot of very serious problems but when we have fun with people we don't see them as different political parties or nationalities are religions reconnect with them as human beings it's worth noting that that is the first step and been able to work together
to solve those problems
fun also makes us healthier now being lonely and stressed out as many of us have been for the past two years causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease but when we have fun relaxed and were more socially connected both of which have the opposite effect
so kind of blows my mind every time i think about it this way but having fun is a health intervention
and then lastly fun is joyful in it we all so desperately want to be happy we read books about happiness we download apps buy happiness but when we are in a moment of having fun we are happy
so makes me think that perhaps the secret to long term happiness is just to have more everyday moments of fun
so how do we do that how do we have more fun well to start with do not take the suggestions you'll find a magazine articles about how to have more fun so i'll i looked up some of these myself when i found suggestions that include are not is up
roasted turkey
put together an altar to loved ones who have passed
watch a documentary about climates
and my personal favorite a during your table with gourds
so go
those are not good suggestions
instead the most effective thing you can do to have more fun is to focus on it's ingredients are which i mean do everything you can to fill your life with more moments of playfulness connection and flow so here's my ideas for how to do so so to star with reduced distractions and order to increase flow anything that distracts you is going to kick you out to flow and prevent you from having
fun
and what's the number one source of distraction for most of us these days
oh thank you
a for target but yes your phones
now i wrote a book called how to break up with your phone so i have strong feelings about this but i can guarantee you that you're not going to have fun if you're constantly on your phone so today i want to challenge you to keep your phone out of your hand as much as possible so the you can take me up my second suggestion which is to increase connection by interacting more with other human being
in real life
now i know that one of the main reasons were causally on our phones is specifically to avoid having to spend time and interact with other human beings in real life
so i want to assure you that it is worth it and it is not as hard as it might seem so here's how you do it you start by making eye contact with someone like look them in the i don't look like in the middle their forehead where the camera would be on a zoom call or
and you say hello
and if that goes well you can introduce yourself
and if that goes well maybe you can ask a question me

news story of to women or an early in the twentieth century
they lived on different coasts they had different religious backgrounds and they were in different stages of life when each experienced an unwanted pregnancy
sally was newly married at the start of the great depression she and her husband decided they couldn't afford to start a family yet
but abortion was illegal in new york city and so she traveled to porto rico to get an illegal abortion
dorothy had recently graduated from high school when she became pregnant by a much older golf instructor her conservative parents shunned her and she had to go away to salvation army home for unwed mothers where she gave birth and place a child for adoption
these women were my grandmother's and their part of the reason i became a demographer and professor studying the causes and consequences of unintended pregnancy
for years people have alleged that abortion harms women the idea that abortion causes mental health harm in particular has been used to justify laws that ban abortion or train dissuade people from choosing it this came to a head in two thousand and seven when supreme court justice and
funny kennedy allowed restrictions on abortion to stand because as he said
while we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon it seems unexceptionable to conclude that some women come to get their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained severe depression and loss of esteem can follow
no reliable data those are words a demographer lives for
we began data collection the very next year
to study the outcomes for people get abortions you need a comparison group ideally people who want an abortion can't get them because they would be in exactly the same circumstances but one group gets the abortion and the other group doesn't my research team at the university of
california san francisco went to thirty abortion facilities across the country each one selected because it was distant enough from other clinics that if someone were to far along in pregnancy for that clinic there was very few other places they could go at each site we focused on recruiting
two groups of people women who were just under the limit and got their abortions and women who showed up a little bit too late and pregnancy and were turned away
i called it the turn away study and the study design was a success in analyzing the data we see those two groups where the same at the start women who received and women who were denied abortions had similar mental health physical health and socio economic well being at the time they saw and a boy
portion we followed almost a thousand women calling them every six months for five years using scientifically validated questions to measure their physical health their mental health and their families well being and we can see that although they started the same those two groups their lives
diverged in ways that could be directly attributed to whether they got their abortion or were turned away
and it didn't work out the way that kennedy had unexceptionable he concluded
in fact we found no mental health harm from abortion and stead we saw higher anxiety lower self esteem lower life satisfaction for the people who are denied the abortion
but this difference didn't last over time the two groups looked the same not because both groups were doing poorly in terms of mental health in fact symptoms of depression and anxiety improved for both groups over time
but the two groups diverged and other important way it's we find worse physical health for women who carry the pregnancy to term and gave birth consistent with a vast medical literature we see that childbirth is associated with greater risk and abortion including hemorrhage
the eclampsia and even death
and the differences in physical health don't end at the time of childbirth for years later we saw higher chronic pain more hypertension and overall worse physical health for women who were denied the abortion and gave birth we also fine large socio economic differences
where women who are denied abortions face more hardships than women who receive abortions
we find an increase in public assistance but it's not enough to make up for a loss of full time employment
women often raising children alone end up falling below the federal poverty level
working with economists i was able to show that those who received and those who were denied abortions or similar economically for years before the year of the unwanted pregnancy but for years after we see more debt lower credit scores and a greater chance of eviction and bankruptcy for people who were
turned away
and one other area of difference i'll mention we see differences in the chance that women set and achieve aspiration or plans for their future this includes things like breaking ties with abusive partners finding high quality romantic relationships getting
advanced educational degrees
financially supporting their older children and even differences in the chance of having an intended pregnancy later
the results of my study consistently show that when there is a difference those who are able to get their wanted abortion did better than those who weren't
this may come as a surprise to people who don't think about why women get abortions women often give many reasons housing and financial circumstances their relationship with the man involved in the pregnancy their need to take care of existing children more than half of those seeking abortions
it's nationally are already parenting at least one child
all of the areas women were concerned about finances children and relationships life aspirations where the areas in which we see differences
in the experiences of those denied abortions we see all their concerns playing out exactly as they anticipated when they were deciding whether to have an abortion
their concerns were justified
over the five years we follow them we see that over ninety five percent of those who received their abortion said it was the right decision for them
very few of those people who gave birth decided to place a child for adoption less than ten percent so there is another example of a supreme court justice making an assumption that turned out to be wrong
may remember any coney barrett in deliberating on ending fifty years were portion rights and our country's suggested that women could drop their babies off at fire stations
we find that once people have taken the risk and need the monumental sacrifice of giving birth to a child most people decide to parent that child adoption is not an easy choice and in fact the women who plays children for adoption
where the most likely to say that they were having difficulty coping with their experience
it's not news to me that some people think abortion is wrong but when someone's in this circumstance where they are pregnant and they cannot support a child and take care of their existing children
or make a decent life for themselves they're trying to make a decision that is right for their life and their family
as the abortion provider doctor george tiller used to say before his murder in two thousand nine trust women
access to safe legal abortion is important for all of us unintended pregnancy is very common in my family in all of our families across our country in red states and lose
dates and across the globe
i've worked with scientists in tunisia columbia south africa bangladesh nepal to study the experiences of people who are pregnant when they aren't ready and we see these same concerns about wanting to have children under the right circles

their hand if you have a relationship in your life at meaningful deal
okay i assumed but always good to check our assumptions
i'm saying this because while i'll be focusing today
on a parent child relationship please know that everything i'm talking about his applicable to any meaningful relationship
so with that in mind let's jump in
so it's sunday night
i'm in my kitchen i just finished cooking dinner for my family and i am on edge i mean i'm exhausted i haven't been sleeping well i'm anxious about the upcoming work week i'm overwhelmed by all the items on my unfinished to do list and then my son walks into the kitchen
he looks at the table and winds chicken again
disgusting
and that fit i snap i look at him and a young what is wrong with you
can you be grateful for one thing in your life
and things get worse from there he screams i hate you he runs out of the room and he slams his bedroom door and now my self loathing session begins as i say to myself what is wrong with me
i've messed up my kid forever
well if you're a parent you've probably felt at pain
for me it comes with an extra layer of shame
i mean i'm a clinical psychologist and my specialty is helping people become better parents
and yet this is true as well there is no such thing as a perfect parent
mistakes and struggles they come with the job but no one tells us what to do next
do we just move on canvas for ten the whole thing never happen
or if i say something what are the words
well for years as a clinical psychologist and private practice i saw client after clients struggle with this question and now as the creator of the parenting content and community platform good inside i see millions of parents around the globe struggle with this issue
all parents yeah
no one knows what to do next
well i'm determined to fill this gap after all there's almost nothing within our interpersonal relationships that can have as much impact as prepare whenever a parent ask me what one parenting strategy should i focus on i always say the same thing get good at repair
so what is repeal
repairs the act of going back to a moment of disconnection taking responsibility for your behavior and acknowledging the impact it had on another and i want to differentiate a repair from an apology because one an apology often looks to shut a conversation down hey i'm sorry
the i yelled can we move on now
a good repair opens one up

so i'm a little test for you
don't panic i'm not here to judge you
it's just a little test again
first get thirty seconds to memorize ten words in the right order
after that he got thirty seconds to write down what you remembered and then finally get thirty seconds to check your answers
so are you guys ready
well we're going to start anyway
so
memorize ten words in the right border in thirty seconds in three two one go
okay stop
now right down with you remember
okay and stop
now quickly check your answers
okay and stop
so
very exciting i read a lot of running and moaning so i robot in stress you out too much
now a moment of reflection
i'd like you to ask yourself
how did i memorized this and was it the best way to do it
now for the generation of my parents and grandparents being able to memorize something like this was an absolutely essential skill but nowadays why would anyone want to remember list of anything he just take a picture the screen and you're done right
so
with all the technology we have these days it seemed as if memorizing is somehow become less important
so why should we then in today's day and age still want to get better i memorizer
well to answer that question i like to tell you a little story
in high school
i flunked grade
twice
after seven years of torture i finally got my diploma
sweet sweet freedom
where would i do with it
i didn't know one thing i did know however was that i didn't want to go back to school because that all learning business
it wasn't cut out for me
so instead i went to sunny california for nine months and their i worked as a bagger not bigger bagger
so in a supermarket either put people's groceries in bags and then i'd get a little tip
surprisingly that year i learned so much i learned out a bag of groceries really really quickly
i learn how to drive a car and in california people are a little bit more open than they are in amsterdam so i also learn how to have a little chat with a stranger just for that of it
that year i discovered that i don't hate learning
just a specific way of doing it
so i decided to go and study psychology
now for the first time ever i was getting information that i absolutely wanted to know now i was spending more time in the library in has been skipping school as a teenager
voluntarily
the only problem was that i was spending all of my time in the library because i never learn how to learn
so i started experimenting with different methods of leading tax of memorizing facts and i got my reading time of three hours per chapter down to one
this way of studying enabled me to do an honors program to get my degree and to fall in love learning
and now i happily work for a company called reminder in which we teach people the science and art of learning
we're trying to bring back into education but we ourselves missed
now for the past three years we've also organized the dutch national memory championship for high schoolers
we do this to show that everybody is capable of amazing feats of memory
but also to show that memorization is about a lot more the just learning your printer your spanish words
and today i also like to share this with you
so in the beginning i made you do this little test
just to make you aware of how your memorizing things right now
next i like to give you a new type of memory experience is that and even sit back and relax
some going as you to find a comfortable position a sip
to closure as
as take a deep breath
now
i wanted a think of someone you know called john
and i wanted to see him
now john just grab the sun
out of this guy and he just threw it on your feet
and now your feet or get a really big and red and swollen because john just through the sun on your feet
now you look to your knees
and on your knees is see ten little guys playing basketball very strange sight
and undershirts you can see and brightly colored letters the new york knicks
so you have some next on your knees
next
you look to wear your thighs are but they're gone
your thighs have been replaced with ford's the cars
they could be ford focuses afford mustangs
your thighs have been replaced with forts
now with your bottom you feel a hard plastic speed
have a go cart vibrating
with your bottom you feel the hard plastic see have a go cart
your belly start rumbling very loudly
so you follow your belly and lead you to mcdonalds
and they're ronald mcdonald start shooting rays of light at you with a reagan
ronald mcdonald a shooting rays of light at you with the reagan
you he hit you on your chest
and now from your chest a big bush of grey hairs is growing
a huge bush grey hairs growing from your chest
so obviously you hurry home to shake it off
and on your door mat you see a letter
so you open it
and it has good news
as you read it you feel a huge weight falling off your shoulders
a huge weight falling off your shoulders his shoulders gonna light and tingly because you just paid all of your bills
big bills little bills each and every bill has been paid for and you have plenty of money to spare
now
you proceed to the bathroom because now on your neck
a bunch of tiny bush's have been blonde haired have appeared
on your neck a bunch of tiny bushes have been blonde hair
and you look in the mirror
suddenly your mouth just started talking all by itself
and it's saying yes we can yes we can yes we can
now you turn around and now the your eyes or ah because donald duck just popped out both your eyes
with a trumpet made of pure gold
now
you can open your eyes again and come back to displace luckily a lot safer here than we just came from
so
i just
made you guys memorized the past ten presidents of the united states of america in the right order
now i'm going to show you and then you can see how many of these you still know so with each body part i'm going as you what happened there have been you could think of it
even better would be if shouted up
now
what happened to your feet
john through the sun yeah president johnson
now
what happened on your knees
nick yes president nixon
okay so what were your dies replaced with
ford's president ford okay and what did you feel with your bottom
okay
president carter yes some people are ahead of the game
oh
now
erm your belly legit to me donald what happened
okay ronald mcdonald shooting rays allow okay so ronald reagan

the case that when we're feeling the most anxious uncomfortable socially awkward versions of ourselves when our hearts are pounding and are palms are sweating and me feel a crawling out of our skin
are we also the most nice and often generic to the people around us
i'm a social psychologists and i've been studying the science of uncomfortable social interactions for over twenty years so everything from new roommate relationships negotiations upward feedback with your boss to doctor patient interactions those moments where you need a break in and say your for the last twenty minutes actually have no idea what you are talking
about can we may be rewind to bed and to study these things i look at three main outcomes first i look at what people say the things we can control how friendly we are how much we complement one another how much we give gracious feedback
second i look at the things that are tougher for us to control our nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing with her hair doodling then and even tone of voice and then i look at the things that are impossible for us to control are under the skin responses are physiology
g r cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate he's types of things that we often don't even really realize that we're feeling and the way i do this is by having people commented lab and interact with each other and a bunch of different settings
and i have them negotiate with each other a had them get acquainted with each other and often it's the case the in these interactions people are required to give some form of feedback to their partner tell them honestly whether thinking or feeling common with an offer for negotiation tell them what they could have done better next time
and i think we all can you know what it feels like to be him when he studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there's a lot of equipment involved and but we plug people are tall of these things to measure these under the skin response as be video tape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned not a get us all into this mindset of what it's like to feel awkward
maybe potentially little bit nice and want you want to think about what was the last awkward interaction the you had a so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments
because in a couple minutes i'm actually gonna randomly call on someone based on your seats to have you come up and share your story of what that moment felt like
so before we do that i just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions so we bring them into the lab we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments within the first twenty seconds we start to see those stress responses that i mentioned the heart rate goes
up their blood pressure increases it doesn't take much to get people to start to feel anxious next we see it and those nonverbal behaviors they start to fidget they avoid eye contact they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who's sitting next to them in an just to get a little bit more distance
one of my favorite findings isn't doctor patient interactions uncomfortable doctors they look down at the chart more are they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with his patients
so let's all return to your awkward moment is everyone have an awkward moment in mind when thinking about when
how many of you have i increases in your heart rate maybe palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just the mere thought of being called upon today
ag a few of you may be what are seeks be excited about that opportunity not and okay same people could pick
how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grant through gritty greeted t like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time
a few the of door am not going to actually do this and this was all just a ruse to teach a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often don't have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable
no one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major from and i brought people together who are used to working with one another
and we had him engage in a negotiation and at the end of it there was a winner in there was a loser
so he said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential miss stops how many of you think that that's what they actually did they really followed are instructions
hey nobody can see where this is going
what we found is that even when we're talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to as we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you me that really early offer and didn't even ask for counter i was amazing or it was so great how you didn't even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change
on a or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation telling him how great they are
so often these kinds of interactions the take the form of what i'll call anxious niceness and they involve lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general non specific way
but a lot of work actually looks at what's what's it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who's giving off these kinds of riddles smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering
a little bit aside i you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end or racial minorities they disadvantage disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudice in front of
and that anxiety is regulated by being over the top nice to these folks
we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronize to and attentive to the how we say a peace than the what we say part someone once teddy we had black and white americans interact with each other in across race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measure the physiology of both partners
what this allowed us to do is captured the degree to which people stress those under the skin responses can actually be caught by their partners
and what we expect to define is that the black participants will become more synchronize physiologically to those whites the be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that's exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared for the fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol sorry
activity indicating some real deep and of under the skin stress response the more those by participants became linked up to them over time
and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress in our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always or owner physiology is not always around and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress a good
negatively affect your body's
no often what we find is the type of feedback the people are actually getting isn't always super direct sometimes it's a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i'm going with as having over the top positive nice feedback can harm your performance you make it very difficult for you to climb up difficulty kind of know where you stand what you should do better with you
need to stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often don't think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context
so imagine the case that you're one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls me be passed employee recruiter cause you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things are going to put are gonna be like there are real team player they have great energy at work generic things
yes there are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves while they must not really know this person at all or even know what this means at worst they think to themselves where they probably have some real opinions they're just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive fee
back kinda actually harm people's reputation when they're not backed up with real data
so i think we have didn't think about what is the solution to this problem is is the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct i don't think that's the case at all i think there are some things we can do and i'm in a highly three of them to improve the degree to which we get clear consistent feedback to people particularly in the workplace
so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with his niceness culture really there's a bit of a plural ignorance the goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work am what i've found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback
there's another person who feels like it's lazy you feel like it's not helpful and i actually learned this lesson the hard way from one of my students recently she was giving our practice talk in my lab and she spent weeks and weeks preparing it on

will we all need a reason to wake up
for me it just took eleven thousand volts
i know you're too polite to ask so i won't tell you
one night sophomore year of college just back from thanksgiving holiday
chu of my friends and i were horsing around with decided to climb a top apart commuter train
just sitting there with the wires and run overhead
so now that seem like a great idea at the time
we'd certainly done stupid or things hum
i screwed up the ladder on the back and when i stood up electrical current entered my arm blue down and out my feet in that was at
what you believe that watch it still works
it takes a likud my father where's it now in solidarity
that night began my formal relationship with death
my death
and it also began my long run as a patient to good word means one who suffers
i guess we're all patients
now the american health care system has more than it's fair share of dysfunction
to match it's brilliance to be sure
oh i'm a physician now a hospice and palliative medicine doc so i've seen care from both sides
and believe me most everyone who goes into healthcare really means well i mean truly
but we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often does not serve
why
there's actually a pretty easy answer that question
and explains a lot
because healthcare was designed with diseases not people at it's center
which is to say of course it was badly designed
and nowhere or the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life
where things are so distilled in concentrated
there's no do overs
my purpose today is to reach out
across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation
that is
to bring intention and creativity to the experience of time
we have a monumental opportunity in front of us before a universal one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society
to rethink and redesign how it is we die
so let's begin at the end
for most people the scariest thing about death isn't being dead it's time suffering the key distinction
and to get underneath this it's can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is
i'm from suffering we can change the former is a natural essential part of life part of the deal
and to this we are called to make space adjust
grow
it can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves
the bring proportionality
i can cosmic right sizing
after my limbs were gone that loss for example became fact fixed necessarily part of my life
and i learned i could no more reject
this facts and reject myself
took me awhile but i'd learned eventually
now another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that
unites caregiver and care receiver
the human beings
this we're finally realizing his where healing happens
yes compassion literally as we learned yesterday suffering together
now on the systems side on the other hand so much of the suffering is unnecessary invented
serves no good purpose
but the good news is since this brand of suffering is made up well we can change it
how we die is indeed something we can affect
i'm making this system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day
after all our role as caregivers
as people who care is to relieve suffering not add to the pile
true to the tenets of palliative care i function as something of a reflective advocate as much as a prescribing physician
a quick aside
part of care very important field but poorly understood
while it includes it is not limited to end of life care is not limited to hospice it simply about comfort and living well at any stage okay so please know that you don't have to be dying any time soon to benefit from palliative care
now let me introduce you to frank
i'm
sort of makes this point i've been seeing frank now for years
is living with advancing prostate cancer on top of longstanding hiv
we work on his bone pain and it's fatigue but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life
really about our lives
then this way frank greaves this way he keeps up with his losses as they role in so that he's ready to take in the next moment
the loss is one thing regret quite another
so frank is always been an adventure looks like some amount of a norman rockwell painting and no fan of regret
so wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day say you wanted to raft down the colorado river
this a good idea
with all the risks to his safety and his health someone say no many did but he went forward while he still could
and it was glorious
marvelous trip
freezing water blistering dry heat scorpion snakes wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the grand canyon
all the glory side of the world
beyond our control
of rice decision while maybe dramatic is exactly the kind so many of us would make if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves
over time
so much about we're talking about today is such a shift in perspective
after my accident when i went back to college i had been changed my major to art history
studying visual art i figured i'd learn something about how to see
oh really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was saying
perspective that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with turning anguish and to a flower
flash forward now i work at a an amazing place in san francisco called this and hospice project where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective
when one of our residents dies
a mortuary men come and as were in the body out through the garden had him for the gave me pause anyone who wants
hello residents family nurses volunteers the her strivers to now
shera story or a song or silence
as we sprinkle the body was flower petals takes a few minutes
sweet simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth
rather than repugnant
contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting
what's like this floodlit room
line with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights don't stop even when the patient's life has
cleaning crews ribs and the bodies was the way it's all feels as though that person had never really existed
well intended of course in the name of sterility but hospitals tend to assault or senses and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness
anesthetic
literally the opposite of aesthetic
i revere hospitals for what they can do i am alive because of them
but we have too much of our hospitals
they are places for acute trauma and treatable illness there no place to live and die
that's not what they were designed for
her mind you i'm not giving up on the notion that our institutions him become more humane beauty can be found anywhere
