so
very exciting i read a lot of running and moaning so i robot in stress you out too much
now a moment of reflection
i'd like you to ask yourself
how did i memorized this and was it the best way to do it
now for the generation of my parents and grandparents being able to memorize something like this was an absolutely essential skill but nowadays why would anyone want to remember list of anything he just take a picture the screen and you're done right
so
with all the technology we have these days it seemed as if memorizing is somehow become less important
so why should we then in today's day and age still want to get better i memorizer
well to answer that question i like to tell you a little story
in high school
i flunked grade
twice
after seven years of torture i finally got my diploma
sweet sweet freedom
where would i do with it
i didn't know one thing i did know however was that i didn't want to go back to school because that all learning business
it wasn't cut out for me
so instead i went to sunny california for nine months and their i worked as a bagger not bigger bagger
so in a supermarket either put people's groceries in bags and then i'd get a little tip
surprisingly that year i learned so much i learned out a bag of groceries really really quickly
i learn how to drive a car and in california people are a little bit more open than they are in amsterdam so i also learn how to have a little chat with a stranger just for that of it
that year i discovered that i don't hate learning
just a specific way of doing it
so i decided to go and study psychology
now for the first time ever i was getting information that i absolutely wanted to know now i was spending more time in the library in has been skipping school as a teenager
voluntarily
the only problem was that i was spending all of my time in the library because i never learn how to learn
so i started experimenting with different methods of leading tax of memorizing facts and i got my reading time of three hours per chapter down to one
this way of studying enabled me to do an honors program to get my degree and to fall in love learning
and now i happily work for a company called reminder in which we teach people the science and art of learning
we're trying to bring back into education but we ourselves missed
now for the past three years we've also organized the dutch national memory championship for high schoolers
we do this to show that everybody is capable of amazing feats of memory
but also to show that memorization is about a lot more the just learning your printer your spanish words
and today i also like to share this with you
so in the beginning i made you do this little test
just to make you aware of how your memorizing things right now
next i like to give you a new type of memory experience is that and even sit back and relax
some going as you to find a comfortable position a sip
