all too often we aim for perfection but never end up doing anything because the stands that we set ourselves and are too high
they're intimidating which stresses out so we delay starting something for we might even as they enter the whole thing altogether
do it badly frees you up to take action
i mean you know how it is so often we want to do something perfectly we can start until it's the perfect time and so we've got all the skills
but this can be daunting and stressful so why not just jump into it just do it however without worrying if it's good or bad
this will make it that much easier to start something and as you're doing it badly to finish it
and when you look back you realize more often than not that actually it's not that bad
