this i did play basketball yeah
i remember the exact day and place my entire life change and i didn't even know it
it's april twenty sixth and i'm eighteen years old i'm in the gym
i'm listening to a podcast as i usually do and i work out
and i heard the podcast guest in my ear say something i'd heard so many of these thirty to sixty something psychologists activists authors and business leaders say many times before
if i have the same mindset now that i did in my teens or twenties i be miserable i was such an idiot
i remember every time i heard those statements express with a laugh
it made me feel
sad i was entering college i didn't want to be miserable and then he folds
actually pretty irritated i refused to be miserable much this refusal of misery had to do with that just five months earlier i had sat hand in hand with my dad as he passed away after a six year battle with the terminal disease ls
following that experience i promised myself i would not spend a moment of my life hating it
as i learned that time is never promised
my irritation intensified as i reflected on the fact that that these personal development leaders are rarely talking to young people specifically distant make any sense to me because i thought aren't we the ones that need to know the stuff about growth mindfulness and emotions the most over the next decade i was supposed to
determine a field of study your career potentially find a life partner decide where to live handle personal finances and retirements maybe even start a family and many other decisions that have life long impacts but here i was with thousands of other high school seniors receiving the same
piece of advice from most of the adults and our lives
you've got time
you'll figure it out
i just don't think you need to worry about it
and although this advice is slightly anxiety reducing in the moment we are rarely if ever given practical emotional and decision making training making the anxiety reducing moments extremely short and fleeting because we didn't know how to navigate these decisions we had to make and so
with the all have moment in the gym i found my mission to change the rhetoric of what your teens and twenties could and should be
which brings me to today
and after a bit more study it turns out teenage live he had some very valid points to points in specific down to a neurological level how we train our brains now in our twenties truly matters when it comes to setting ourselves up for a less stressful
more and more fulfilling life
your brain is a complex system of neurological pathways you can think of it like a complex system of roads the more you drive specific routes the more ingrained those habits and behavioral patterns become and that is why it's so important we start specifically choosing which routes
we continue to drive down now because it will be much more painful and difficult to rewire your mind thirty years from now when your mental software has become hardware
and point number to tunisia libya was also onto the fact that the decisions we make in our twenties do matter
but that is why we need and proper emotional and mental skills to help guide us in those decisions make j p h d clinical psychologist nose in her newly revised book the defining decade these statistics that might shake up any young adult a bit
eighty five percent of life's most defining moments happened before age thirty five not the most important not the best moments but life define or is are often happening before your mid thirties
your twenties coincide with your peak childbearing years or than fifty percent of us will be living with a dating or married to our life partner by age thirty you're earning power is generally decided in your first ten years of work and as you probably know in your childhood that's where you will have peak brain development
it but your personality and your brain changes more in your twenties than any time before or after
these statistics show us that the decisions you make in your twenties do in fact matter but to any young adult listening i do want to note these are statistics correlation does not always mean causation but still whether we like it or not we do have some big decisions to make over
the next decade let's dig even deeper
we are humans not statistics as i mentioned so instead of going to google i went to humans to create my own type of study on the matter i spent my career thus far talking to today's teens and twenty somethings about what they actually need to feel
more prepared for their life
i wrote a book answering their questions i started a podcast educating them on the topics that their parents were the education system generally weren't teaching them
i created an online platform reaching millions of them worldwide and i stand here today being a physical representation of what is often represented as a statistic where or teens and twenty somethings struggling most
the common thread did not have to do with being addicted to their phones it didn't have to do with being bullied by their peers are being overly stressed about school or work the common thread was much more conclusive
a feeling of being constantly at war with their minds
but it's not the twenty first century that is the culprit of this mental mass distress is that historically we have rarely if ever put any true emphasis on the development of emotional and decision making skills we need
change
or young adults or children or parents raising our children and young adults need better mental and emotional skills to better create a future for themselves their families their communities and society at large what is going on inside of a
each of us creates the reality of what is happening outside of each of us
these emotional skills
these are not what we call soft skills
these are life changing life saving society altering skills
so how do we make this change well it turns out changing the way society functions on a mass scale is a little bit difficult which you know is probably not very shocking but still with my work with young people over the years i have found
three core pillars of information that can help young people have a simple foundation of better emotional intelligence better decision making skills and empathetic self guided growth which brings us to pillar number one
on learning
there are many unhelpful social constructs that way down today's youth
being the great on your paper determines your intelligence or you're supposed to be nothing but young and dumb right now or my personal favorite this needs to be the best time of your life
so annoying
but the most harmful of all is the way many of us are socially conditioned to determine what a happy and successful life looks like and how to actually achieve it
my dad was a very money driven man carrying a very money driven and as his daughter i inherited a lot of that money driven energy the idea that if i just made enough money that's where i would find peace but for years i watch that same mindset
tear him apart absolutely destroying his ability to have peace
and i didn't want that
so i ask myself okay if i can't determine the success of my life based off of money or status howard net worth how do i determine that i'm living a successful life how do i gauge it
i contemplated that question for a really long time until i found on answer
living in alignment
living in alignment is aligning your core priorities
your actions and your thoughts with your deepest core values
so in your head hits the pillow at night and you can ask yourself am i living as aligned as i can in this moment
and you can truthfully answer that question with yes
that is what peace feels like
because there's nothing more to long for with that mindset the only person that is in charge of your success is you
