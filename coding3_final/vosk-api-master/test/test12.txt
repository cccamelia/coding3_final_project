i had just driven home it was around midnight and the dead of montreal winter i'd been visiting my friend jeff across town and the thermometer on the front porch read minus forty degrees
and don't bother asking if that celsius or fahrenheit minus forty is where the to scales meet and it was very cold and as i stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets i found i didn't have my keys
in fact i could see them through the window lying on the dining room table where i had left them so i quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows and they were locked tight i thought about calling a locksmith at least i had my cell phone but at midnight it could take a while for a locksmith the show up and it was cold
i couldn't go back to my friend just house for the night because i had an early flight to your of the next morning and i needed to get my passport my suitcase
so desperate and freezing cold i found a large rock and i broke through the basement window cleared out the shards of glass i crawled through i found a piece of cardboard and tapes it up over the whole opening figuring that in the morning on the way to the airport i could call my contractor and ask him to to fix it this was going to be expensive but probably
no more expensive than the middle of the night locksmith so i figured under the circumstances i was coming out even
now i'm a neuroscientist by training and i know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress it releases cortisol that raises your heart rate it a modulator adrenaline levels and it clouds you thinking
so the next morning
when i woke up on too little sleep worrying about the whole in the window and a mental note that i had to call my contractor in the freezing temperatures and the meetings i had up coming in europe and your with all the cortisol in my brain my thinking was cloudy but i didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloud
three and
it wasn't until i got to the airport check in counter that i realized i didn't have my passport
so i raised home in the snow and ice forty minutes got my passport raced back to the airport i made it just in time but they'd given away my seat to someone else so i got stuck in the back of the play next to the bathrooms in a seat that wouldn't recline on an eight hour flight
well i had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep
and i started wondering are the things that i can do systems that i can put into place it'll prevent bad things from happening or at least a bad things happen will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe
so i started thinking about that but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later i was having dinner with my colleague danny condom in the nobel prize winner and i somewhat embarrassed bleed told him about having broken my window and you know forgot my passport and danny shared with me that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight
if it's something that he had gotten from the psychologist gary klein who had written about it a few years before also called the pre mortem now you all know what the postmortem is whenever there's a disaster of your team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong right well in the pre mortem danny explain you look at
head you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong and then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent those things from happening or to minimize the damage so what i want to talk to about city or some other things we can do in the form of a pre mortem some of them are obvious some of them are not so obvious i'll start with the og of
yes ones around the home designate a place for things that are easily lost now this sounds like common sense it it is but there's a lot of science to back this up based on the way our spatial memory works there is a structure in the brain called the hippocampus that evolved over time
tens of thousands of years to keep track of the locations of important things where the well as were fish can be found that stand of fruit trees
where the friendly an enemy tribes live the hippocampus is the part of the brain that in london taxi cab drivers becomes enlarged it's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts and if you're wondering somebody actually did the experiment where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels and they could still find they're not they weren't using so
smell they were using the hippocampus this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things but it's really good for things that don't move around much not so good for things that move around so this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports so in the home designated spot for your
keys are hooked by the door maybe a decorative bowl for your passport a particular drawer for your reading glasses a particular table if you designate a spot and your scrupulous about it you things will always be there when you look for what about travel take a cell phone picture of your credit cards your driver's license your passport
mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud if these things are lost or stolen you can facilitate replacement out these are some rather obvious things
remember when you're under stress the brain releases cortisol cortisol as toxic and it causes cloudy thinking so part of the practice of the pre mortem is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best and you should put systems in place at there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're confronted
with a medical decision to me and at some point all of us are going to be in that position where we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one to help them with the decision as i want to talk about that and i'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition but the stands as a proxy for all kinds of medic
cool decision making and indeed for financial decision making and social decision making any kind of decision you have to make that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts so suppose you go to your doctor in the doctor says i just got your blab work back your cholesterol is a little high
now you all know the cholesterol is high cholesterol is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease heart attack stroke and so you thinking having high cholesterol isn't the best thing and so the doctor says you know i'd like to give you a drug it'll help you lower your cholesterol a stack and you probably heard of stat and you know that they're among
the most widely prescribed drugs in the world today you probably even know people who take them and so you think and yeah give me the stat
but there's a question you should ask at this point a statistic you should ask for that most doctors don't like talking about and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less
it's for the number needed to treat
and what is this the an empty it's the number of people that need to take a drug or undergo surgery or any medical procedure before one person has helped
and you thinking what kind of crazy statistic is that like the number should be one my doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me if it's not going to help but actually medical practice doesn't work that way and is not the doctors fault if if anybody's fault it's the fault of scientists like me we haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough but glaxo smithkline estimates that now
ninety percent of the drugs work in only thirty to fifty percent of the people so the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed staten what do you suppose it is
how many people have to take it before one person's helped three hundred
this is according to research by research practitioners jerome groopman and pamela hurts span independently confirmed by bloomberg dot com i ran through the numbers myself
three hundred people have to take the drug for a year before one heart attack stroke or other adverse event is prevented now you're probably thinking well okay one in three hundred chance of lowering my cholesterol why not doc give gimme the prescription anyway but you should ask if this point for another statistic and that is tell me about the side effects right so for this but
ticket or drug the side effects occur in five percent of the patience and they include terrible things debilitating muscle and joint pain gastrointestinal distress but now you're thinking well five percent not very likely it's going to happen to me i'll still take the drug but wait a minute member under stress we're not thinking clearly so think about how you a work through this ahead
at times you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot three hundred people take the drug right one person's helped five percent of those three hundred have side effects that's fifteen people
