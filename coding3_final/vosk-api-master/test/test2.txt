what is love seriously enough what is it what is love a verb a noun a universal truth an ideal the common thread of all religions a cult a neurological phenomenon there's no shortage of answers some are all encompassing it conquers all it's all you mean it's
all there is these are all comparisons to have ways of defining it by contrast by saying it's more important than all other things but is it sure love matters more than your standard turkey sandwich but does it matter more than shelter or sanity or an exceptional turkey sandwich
no matter your answer your just ranking it not defining it another challenge to defining love is we often try to do so while falling into it or out of it would you trust someone who just won the lottery to accurately define the concept of currency for i don't know ask a guy to define bears while he's sending them off
or is romance not like winning the lottery or breakups not like bear attacks
bad comparisons that's my point i'm not thinking right because i'm in love so ha
taking a step back or the taking a cold shower whatever love is potentially the most intensely thought about thing in all of human history and despite centuries upon centuries of obsession it still overwhelms us some say it's a feeling a magical emotion a feeling for someone like you've never felt before but feelings are fluid
not very concrete foundation for a definition sometimes you hate the person you love plus come on you felt feelings like it before sort of in miniature your relationships with your family shape your relationships with partners and your love for your partner may be in it's own dynamic relationship healthy or totally weird with the love of your parents in
siblings love is also a set of behaviors we associate with the feeling
holding hands kissing hugging public displays of affection dating marriage having kids or just sex but these loving actions can be subjective or culturally relative you may love or be someone who can't have kids or doesn't want to who believes in marriage but also in divorce who's from a culture where
people don't really date the way we think of dating for who'd just doesn't want to make out on the bus but if love is a thing that we can define and how can it mean opposite things for so many people so maybe loves all just in your head a personal mystery winding through your neural pathways and lighting up please a natural rewards in your nervous system
perhaps these rewards are addictive perhaps love is a temporary or permanent addiction to a person just like a person can be addicted to drugs
i don't mean to be edgy like some pop song evidence shows that chemicals in your brain stimulated by another person can make you develop a had it for that person the person comes to satisfy a physiological craving and you want more but then sometimes slowly or suddenly you don't you fallen out of love become on addicted for a spell what happen
and does one develop a tolerance or hit a limit might have some lovers stay addicted to each other their entire lives perhaps to create new lives to proliferate their species maybe love is just human dna is optimal method for bringing about it's own replication their evolutionary arguments regarding every human mating behavior from how we display ourselves to potential mates
to how we treat each other and relationships to how we raise kids thus some argue that the feeling you think you feel in your soul is just biology's way to make you continue our species nature has selected you to have crushes on hotties just like it makes monkeys have crushes on hot monkeys and biology marches on
but is that all of his or perhaps worse is it just a construct some fake concept we all convince each other to try to live up to for a fake sense of purpose maybe it is a construct but let's be more precise about what a construct is because love is constructed from reality our experiences feelings brain chemistry cultural expectations are
lives and this edifice can be viewed through countless dimensions scientific emotional historical spiritual legal or just person is no two people are the same no to people's love is the same either so in every loving relationship there's a lot to talk about and partners should be open to that
or the relationship probably won't last love is always up for discussion and sure under construction
so if we can't define it that's a good sign it means we're all still making it
wait i didn't mean you know what i meant
dying
