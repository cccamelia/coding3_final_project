will we all need a reason to wake up
for me it just took eleven thousand volts
i know you're too polite to ask so i won't tell you
one night sophomore year of college just back from thanksgiving holiday
chu of my friends and i were horsing around with decided to climb a top apart commuter train
just sitting there with the wires and run overhead
so now that seem like a great idea at the time
we'd certainly done stupid or things hum
i screwed up the ladder on the back and when i stood up electrical current entered my arm blue down and out my feet in that was at
what you believe that watch it still works
it takes a likud my father where's it now in solidarity
that night began my formal relationship with death
my death
and it also began my long run as a patient to good word means one who suffers
i guess we're all patients
now the american health care system has more than it's fair share of dysfunction
to match it's brilliance to be sure
oh i'm a physician now a hospice and palliative medicine doc so i've seen care from both sides
and believe me most everyone who goes into healthcare really means well i mean truly
but we who work in it are also unwitting agents for a system that too often does not serve
why
there's actually a pretty easy answer that question
and explains a lot
because healthcare was designed with diseases not people at it's center
which is to say of course it was badly designed
and nowhere or the effects of bad design more heartbreaking or the opportunity for good design more compelling than at the end of life
where things are so distilled in concentrated
there's no do overs
my purpose today is to reach out
across disciplines and invite design thinking into this big conversation
that is
to bring intention and creativity to the experience of time
we have a monumental opportunity in front of us before a universal one of the few universal issues as individuals as well as a civil society
to rethink and redesign how it is we die
so let's begin at the end
for most people the scariest thing about death isn't being dead it's time suffering the key distinction
and to get underneath this it's can be very helpful to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is
i'm from suffering we can change the former is a natural essential part of life part of the deal
and to this we are called to make space adjust
grow
it can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves
the bring proportionality
i can cosmic right sizing
after my limbs were gone that loss for example became fact fixed necessarily part of my life
and i learned i could no more reject
this facts and reject myself
took me awhile but i'd learned eventually
now another great thing about necessary suffering is that it is the very thing that
unites caregiver and care receiver
the human beings
this we're finally realizing his where healing happens
yes compassion literally as we learned yesterday suffering together
now on the systems side on the other hand so much of the suffering is unnecessary invented
serves no good purpose
but the good news is since this brand of suffering is made up well we can change it
how we die is indeed something we can affect
i'm making this system sensitive to this fundamental distinction between necessary and unnecessary suffering gives us our first of three design cues for the day
after all our role as caregivers
as people who care is to relieve suffering not add to the pile
true to the tenets of palliative care i function as something of a reflective advocate as much as a prescribing physician
a quick aside
part of care very important field but poorly understood
while it includes it is not limited to end of life care is not limited to hospice it simply about comfort and living well at any stage okay so please know that you don't have to be dying any time soon to benefit from palliative care
now let me introduce you to frank
i'm
sort of makes this point i've been seeing frank now for years
is living with advancing prostate cancer on top of longstanding hiv
we work on his bone pain and it's fatigue but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life
really about our lives
then this way frank greaves this way he keeps up with his losses as they role in so that he's ready to take in the next moment
the loss is one thing regret quite another
so frank is always been an adventure looks like some amount of a norman rockwell painting and no fan of regret
so wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day say you wanted to raft down the colorado river
this a good idea
with all the risks to his safety and his health someone say no many did but he went forward while he still could
and it was glorious
marvelous trip
freezing water blistering dry heat scorpion snakes wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the grand canyon
all the glory side of the world
beyond our control
of rice decision while maybe dramatic is exactly the kind so many of us would make if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves
over time
so much about we're talking about today is such a shift in perspective
after my accident when i went back to college i had been changed my major to art history
studying visual art i figured i'd learn something about how to see
oh really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change so much of what he was saying
perspective that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with turning anguish and to a flower
flash forward now i work at a an amazing place in san francisco called this and hospice project where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective
when one of our residents dies
a mortuary men come and as were in the body out through the garden had him for the gave me pause anyone who wants
hello residents family nurses volunteers the her strivers to now
shera story or a song or silence
as we sprinkle the body was flower petals takes a few minutes
sweet simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth
rather than repugnant
contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting
what's like this floodlit room
line with tubes and beeping machines and blinking lights don't stop even when the patient's life has
cleaning crews ribs and the bodies was the way it's all feels as though that person had never really existed
well intended of course in the name of sterility but hospitals tend to assault or senses and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness
anesthetic
literally the opposite of aesthetic
i revere hospitals for what they can do i am alive because of them
but we have too much of our hospitals
they are places for acute trauma and treatable illness there no place to live and die
that's not what they were designed for
her mind you i'm not giving up on the notion that our institutions him become more humane beauty can be found anywhere
