linda is the poster child for what i call the counter conventional mindsets of entrepreneurs
so i went to tell you about these mindsets today and here we go so number one why do i call them countered conventional well first these six mindsets run counter to the best practices as we call them that are done and big companies today they fly in the face of lunch of which we teach
atlanta business school and other business schools a bad strategy about marketing about the risk and about much more now you might say john where do you mean by mindset
a mindset of course is up here right is it it's those things that attitudes habits thoughts mental inclination which when something comes our way pre determined the response we make to that something that comes our way and those something says we entrepreneurs call them are opportunities
is so i want to tell you about these six mindsets and the first one i call yes we can now be school strategy one or one says the following what we're supposed to do and a company is stick to our knitting we've gotta figure what what we're really good at be i'm them core competencies and we've gotta build on them invest in them
nurture them make them more robust and if somebody comes along and says can you do something different it's outside of that what are we supposed to say no i'm sorry we don't do that around here
well
a brazilian entrepreneur a bottle korea dope a wonderful business that today is called admiral digital by disregarding those rules he had already reinvented his business twice to become a major provider of event management and production services when one of his cause
summers said to him you know i have two hundred and sixty stores scattered all around brazil and brazil's the big country and i like to be able to broadcast a trading and motivational events to the stores in real time so arnold could we put televisions in the training room of all my stores and could we build a satellite uplink so
we can send all this wonderful stuff to the stores so what did he say he said yes we can do that even though he knew nothing about satellite technology and never operated outside so so paolo a buddy got it done then several years later some of the other customers one of them in particular walmart said well
jarod it's nice that we have all of these said these television screens in the back room with the store but wouldn't it be cool if we had them on the sales floor because then we could run advertising so when the customer walks down the aisle for detergent perhaps says an after proctor and gamble stuttered of in that i'll and what it arnold say to that request
yes we can do that
over a period of years arnold reinvented his business fundamentally for different times by saying when a customer wanted something new that lay outside his core competencies yes weaker the second well i want to tell you about i call problem first not product for logic so a big companies today
it's all about the products so when i'm in the u s my family and i have used tied for many years to wash our clothes
and there we got a chuckle every now and then because we can tell a new brand manager has come along because what happens they change the product right they take the blues speckles out of it and turn them green and they call it new improved is this innovation guys i'm not so sure
coca cola what it what is there there was a classic coke and then there is no coke that didn't work out too well then there was diet coke and coke zero and vanilla coke and cherry coke lots of coach
i don't think this is what innovation is all about but for entrepreneurs we don't focus on products we focus on problems saw a guy named jonathan thorn developed the technology the did something very useful this instrument you see in front of you is called a surgical for sip
it's the tool that almost every surgeon in any kind of medical discipline uses to do his or her work but there's a problem with these surgical forceps
