i began to observe something in my own behavior that may be a bit
uncomfortable
and that was that from the moment that i woke up to the morning that to to the end of the day my life was a series of screens i started the day with the thing that woke me up first thing in them or morning my phone and so i sat there in bed watching various cooking videos on instagram and bouncing around between a bunch of different apple
occasions but then it was time to get out of bed and cook breakfast and so the thing that i focus then on and in addition to the omelette in the pan was of the i pad that was right next to the oven and then it was time to do some work and so i went to a different screen which was attached to another screen itself all the while this live
all devil and my rest was tapping and beeping and blue being and distracting me as i was trying to get important stuff done
but there was one particular offender out of all of these different devices that i wasted more time on than anything else that was this dastardly thing my phone i can spend hours on this thing every single day and so i decided to essentially
for all intents and purposes get rid of the thing for a month as an experiment i thought i'm going to live on this thing for just thirty minutes every single day at a maximum and so this is the amount of time i have for maps this is the amount of time to call my mother this is the amount of time that i have for everything that i could possibly want to do to listen to music to listen to
the podcast and i observed what happened during this time
it took about a week
to adjust downward into a new lower level of stimulation but once i did i noticed that three curious things began to happen
first my attention spit and group it was like i could focus on things that effortlessly but with much more ease than i could be for this experiment start
in addition to this though as i was going about the world and especially when my mind wandered about i had more ideas
that my mind arrived on and on top of this i had more plans and thoughts about the future
getting rid of one simple device lead to these three effects
why
noticing that is a few years back lead me on this long journey to get to the bottom of what it takes to focus in a world of distraction i pored over hundreds of research papers from front to back of my office i don't have you ever watch well as crime shows where somebody solving
a murder and so they have this big bristol board and their string attached the papers that to memos it has a newspaper good is this is like what the state of the office was i flew out to meet experts around the world who study focused i conducted more experiments on myself and tell the point i had twenty five thousand words of research notes about why this
is the case how does technology influence our attention and our ability to focus
i want to start with the attention spans that we have this is how we pay attention to the world around us and how much control we have over our focus the research around this particular area is fascinating it turns out that when we to work in front of a computer especially when our
phone is nearby we focus on one thing for just forty seconds before we switch to doing something else
and when we have things like slack open as we're doing some work this lowers to the thirty five seconds
but the reason that this is the case is not what we might think after looking at the research we think the problem is that our brains are distracted but after looking at the research to this is what i've come to know as a symptom for the deeper problem which runs was were deeply the root cause
of this distraction it's not that were distracted it's that our brains are over stimulated it's that we crave distraction in the first place our brains love these tiny little nugget serve information and social media an email and these things that we do of course
of the day there's even a mechanism in our mine called the novelty buys by which are mind rewards us with a hit of doping me one of those those wonderful camera pleasure chemicals the same one that we get when we eat in order a whole media pizza from domino's that you know the same one that we get when we make love we get that same stimulate
asian when we check facebook we got this the opening coursing through i'm i'm in so we not only crave distraction from our mind rewards us for seeking out and finding
destruction in the first place
so this is the state of our minds today we're at this hyper stimulated state where we bounced around between these bunch of different objects of attention that are very very stimulating for are mine
and so i thought okay if the phone had this impact on my attention span what if i lowered how stimulated i was even more still and so have this feeling that we experience when we go from being in a state of high stimulation into a state of low stimulation it has a name
that name is color or or them
you know this is restless is that we feel when we have is super busy talking that were lying on the couch on a sunday afternoon thing and
so i challenge time i put on encounter the readers of my life
is the most boring thing that you can think of doing i'm going to make myself board for an hour a day for a month
and so i did so now it's still linux or for cool
i'm upset about from readers to this day day one i read the i tunes terms and conditions for one hour
it's actually shorter and more readable any might think day for i waited on hold with air canada as baggage claims department it's very easy
this is the check if you want to make your support don't call the reservations department called the baggage claim people because you're going to wait for our as if you ever get through it all day nineteen i counted all the zeroes that i could in the first ten thousand digits of pi
the twenty four i watch the clock
dec
check her one hour
and twenty seven other activities this month
she's i still think that but curiously i noticed that the exact same effects as i did during the smartphone experiment
it took about a week for my mind to adjust downward into a new or lower level of stimulation and this maps curious on top of research that shows that it takes our mind about eight days to fully calm down and rest like when we're on vacation as an example or vacations need to be longer than they are today
but i also noticed that my attention span expanded i was able to focus even more effortlessly because
i wasn't surrounded by fewer distractions but my mind was so much less stimulated that it did not seek the distraction in the first place
but the fun part where these ideas and plans that struck me that didn't before and the reason that this is the case is because my mind had a chance to wander more often
there is a great quote that i love that you might be familiar with from jay are talking or he says that not all those who wander are lost
and the exact same thing is true it turns out with regard to our focus with regard to our attention if you think back
two when your best most brilliant ideas strike you you rarely focused on something maybe this morning you are taking a shower
or maybe some morning in the past and then you're mine had a chance to connect several of the constellations of ideas that were swirling around in your mind to create an idea that would never have materialized otherwise if you were focused on something else on your phone
for example
this is a mode especially when we do this deliberately when we deliberately letter my wandered i call this mode scatter focus and the research shows that it lets or mine come up with ideas it lets or my plan because of where our mind wanders to this is fascinating it turns out that when we just let our attention rest
it goes to three main places we think about the past we think about the present and we think about the future but we think about the past less than we might think only about twelve percent of the time and often the time were recalling ideas in these thought wandering episodes
but the president which is a much more productive place to wander we wander to think about the present twenty eight percent of the time and so this is something as simple as you're typing up an email and you can't find a way to phrase something as it's very delicate mean it's political you go and want to another room you go to other
rumor house of the officer solution hits you because you're mine had a chance to approach and product that problem from different directions
but here's the thing our minds wander to think about the future more than the past and the present combined
whenever our mind is wandering we think about the future forty eight percent of the time this is why when we're taking a shower we plan out our entire day even though it hasn't started yet
this is called our minds prospective buyers and it occurs when our mind wanders
if you're good with math or maps and say not in canada anymore these numbers don't add up to and hundreds because the rest of the time or my is don't it's blamed for it doesn't have an idea inside of it that is rooted in
