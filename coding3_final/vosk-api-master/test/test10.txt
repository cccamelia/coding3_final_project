their hand if you have a relationship in your life at meaningful deal
okay i assumed but always good to check our assumptions
i'm saying this because while i'll be focusing today
on a parent child relationship please know that everything i'm talking about his applicable to any meaningful relationship
so with that in mind let's jump in
so it's sunday night
i'm in my kitchen i just finished cooking dinner for my family and i am on edge i mean i'm exhausted i haven't been sleeping well i'm anxious about the upcoming work week i'm overwhelmed by all the items on my unfinished to do list and then my son walks into the kitchen
he looks at the table and winds chicken again
disgusting
and that fit i snap i look at him and a young what is wrong with you
can you be grateful for one thing in your life
and things get worse from there he screams i hate you he runs out of the room and he slams his bedroom door and now my self loathing session begins as i say to myself what is wrong with me
i've messed up my kid forever
well if you're a parent you've probably felt at pain
for me it comes with an extra layer of shame
i mean i'm a clinical psychologist and my specialty is helping people become better parents
and yet this is true as well there is no such thing as a perfect parent
mistakes and struggles they come with the job but no one tells us what to do next
do we just move on canvas for ten the whole thing never happen
or if i say something what are the words
well for years as a clinical psychologist and private practice i saw client after clients struggle with this question and now as the creator of the parenting content and community platform good inside i see millions of parents around the globe struggle with this issue
all parents yeah
no one knows what to do next
well i'm determined to fill this gap after all there's almost nothing within our interpersonal relationships that can have as much impact as prepare whenever a parent ask me what one parenting strategy should i focus on i always say the same thing get good at repair
so what is repeal
repairs the act of going back to a moment of disconnection taking responsibility for your behavior and acknowledging the impact it had on another and i want to differentiate a repair from an apology because one an apology often looks to shut a conversation down hey i'm sorry
the i yelled can we move on now
a good repair opens one up
