the have you here
let's see a festival in oh congratulations you really put off something remarkable on on on that really you achieve second the very few people do which was you pulled off a kind of a bipartisan consensus in us politics was by
it off the bat is was that that consensus largely seem to be we must ban tick tick tock so we're going to come to that and a bit and i'm curious about that before we before we got that we need to know about you
you you seem to me like remarkable has and want to know a bit of your story and how you came to tick tock in the in the first place okay thank you chris but before we do that can i just checked need to know my audience how many of you hear use account
oh thank you for those who donned the wife is free
so that the get another costume which is how many of you here have had your lives touched through tick tock through your kids and other people in your lives
i mean it's it's or there's a great to see if it's basically if you're alive you have had some kind of contact with the ticked off at this point sell tell us about you so my name is show and i'm from singapore
roughly ten years ago i met with some to engineers who are building a product and idea behind this was the buddha product that
recommended content of people not based on who the new which was are you feeling about ten years ago
it was all the social graph was all the rage and do as you know your content and of fee that you saw should be based on people are you knew now been ten years ago these two engineers thought of something different which is instead of showing you what you let you know is that of for showing you people you knew what do we show your content and you'd like
right
and that sort of the genesis and a birth of from you know the early intimations of tick tock and about five years ago with the advent of i'm in a for g short video mobile phone penetration to come was born and a couple years ago you'd i had opportunity to run this company and is still excise be every single day
so i want to dig in a little more into this about what was it that made this take off sex pleasant because that that the language i hear from people who spent time on it it's sort of like i mean it it it it is a different level of addiction to other
media out there and i don't necessarily mean this and that in a good way will be coming onto this good and bad things about this type of addiction but it's the feeling that within a couple days of of experience of ticked up it knows you and it and it surprises you with things that you didn't know you were going to be interested in but you are how is it really just not instead
the social graph one of these algorithms doing the i think to describe this or to begin to answer your question we have to talk about the mission of the company or the mission is to inspire creativity and to bring joy and i think it on missions for companies like ours is really important because you have product managers working on a product everything
all day and they need to have a stock in or something do so to work towards together
now based on this mission our vision is to provide three things door users we want to provide a window to discover and i'll talk about discovery you talked about this in a second we want to give them a canvas to create which is going to be really exciting with new technologies in ai there's gonna help people in a help people create new things
and the final thing is bridges for people to connect so this would have the vision of what we're trying to build know what really makes tickled very unique and very different is the whole discovery engine behind us so the earlier apps that i have a lot of respect for but there were built for different purpose in for example in the era of
search you know there was an app that was built for people who wanted to search things that was eaten took the saudis more easily the serve found and then in the era of social graphs it was about connecting people enough followers not what we have done is that we are based on ah machine learning algorithms were showing people what they like and what this means is
we have given the everyday person a platform to be discovered if you have talent it is very very easy to get discovered on tick tock and i'll just give you one one example of this the biggest create on tick tock is a guy called copy
copy was from senegal he listened italy he was a factory worker
she you know for the longest time didn't even speak in any of his videos but what he did was in the had talent he was funny he had a good expression he had creativity so we kept posting and today he has one hundred and sixty million followers on our platform so every single day we hear stories like that in a businesses people with talent and i think
is very it's very freeing to have a platform where as long as you have talent you going to be hurt and you have the chance to succeed and as well be providing door users
so this is this is the amazing thing to me like we must have a have grown grown up with say network television for were for decades you've had thousands of brilliant creative people calling in the trenches trying to imagine stuff that will be amazing for an audience and none of them ever remotely came up with anything that know
like many of your creators so so the that that these algorithms by just by observing people's behavior what they look like have discovered things that thousands of believe humans never discovered tell me some of the things that it is looking at so obvious things like have some presses like or stay
is on a video for a long time that gives you a clue more like that but is it subject matter what what what did that one of the one of the array of things that you have noticed that you can actually track that the provide useful to lose the i'm going to simplify this a lot but the machine learning the recommendation algorithm is really just math so for example if you
what if you like videos one two three and four and i like videos one two three and five maybe he liked videos one two three and six know what's gonna happen is because we like one two three yeah the same time he's going to be shown four five six and so army and you can thing about this repeated at skill in real time across more than a billion people sp
basically what this is his math in of course you know ai and machine learning has allowed this to be done at a very very big skill and what we have seen the result of this is that he learns the interest signals that people exhibit very quickly and shows you content is really relevant for you
in a very in in a very quick way not so it's for it's a form of collaborative filtering from what you're saying that yes the theory behind it is the is humans a weird people we don't really know there's them but if if we see that one human is interested with an overlap of someone else chances are you know you can you can make use of the other pieces that are in that overlap
humans repertoire to to to feed feed them and they'll be surprised but the reason they like it is because their power also like that it's his pattern recognition based on your interest signals and i think the other thing here is that we don't actually ask you twenty questions on whether you like a piece of content you know what are your interest we don't do that we
built that experience organically into the of experience so you're voting with a thumbs in know by watching a video you know by citing it by liking it by sharing it you're basically exhibiting interest signals and what it does and a medically is a take those signals put in a formula and a matches it through pattern recognition that's basically the
idea behind it
i mean lots of
startups have tried to use these these types of techniques i'm wondering what else played a role early on him and how how big a deal was a the from the get go you optimizing for smartphones so the videos was shot in for correct format and and they and they were short was that it was that an early distinguishing thing that mattered i think we would have first the really tried
this scale you know the recommendation algorithm is a very important reason as to why the the perform is so popular occur among so many people are beyond that you mention
the format of itself so we talked about the vision of the company which has to have a window to discover in if you sort of just up for the first time you see to it takes up your screen so does the window that we want you can imagine a lot of people using that window to discover new things in their lives then you know through this recommendation algorithm we have found it
it connects people together people find communities and i've heard so many stories of people were found their communities because of the contended a posting now give you an example of
i was in dc recently and i met with a bunch of creators i heard
and so one of them are sitting next to me at a dinner his name is samuel he was a restaurant in phoenix arizona and is a taco restaurant he told me he's never done this before first you know venture
she started posting on this content on tick tock end up you know i saw his content in looks of i was hungry after looking at it's is great you know content in his generators so much interest in his business the last year he mean something like a million dollars in revenue
just via tick tock one restaurant and in again and again a huge his stories by connecting people together by giving people the window to discover we have forgiven many small businesses and many people your common person a voice that it would never otherwise have and i think that's the power of the platform
so you definitely have identified early just how in our social creatures we need affirmation i'm i've had a story and you can tell me whether true or not the one of the keys to your early lift off was that you want to persuade creators who are trying out tick tock that this was a platform where you know they would get whisper
early on when you're trying to grow something in the numbers on that response so you had a brilliant idea of goosing those numbers a bit basically finding ways to give people you know a big a sense of lot more likes more engagement and was actually the case by using a i agent somehow in the in the process is is a brilliant idea is that are the
just a myth i would
i would i would describe it in a different way so the other platforms to exist they don't with before tick tock in if you think about this platforms you sort of have to be famous already in order to go followers because the we is build is that people come and follow people and if we don't if you aren't really famous the chances that you get discovered a very
every law now what we have done again because of the difference in the we were recommended content is that we have given any one any single person with enough talent a speech to be able to be discovered in i think that actually is the single probably the most important thing contributing to the growth of the platform and again and again you will hear stories
from people who use the platform or post regularly on it that if the have something you want to see the performed just them the chance and the stage to connect with the audience in a way that i think no other products in the past as ever offered them
so i'm i'm just trying to play back what what use what you said they you said you were describing their differ way what i what i said is is it that in the case that like to give someone a decent chance someone who's brilliant but doesn't come with any follow as initially that you you have you got some technique to identify talent and that you will you will almost encourage them you will you will give them some guy
and of from artificially increase the number of followers were like so whatever that they have so the others are encouraged to go wow there's something there and so forth like it's this idea of critical mass that kind of every entrepreneur every party planner kind of those about of the know this is the hot place in town everyone calm and that that is how you actually game critical mass we we wanted
sure that every person who posts a video is given and an equal chance to be able to have some audience to begin with but this idea that you are the media alluding to that we can get people to like something it doesn't really work like that you don't then you get could you get a i agents to like something for you see the network way
with extra and for could kind of get you know give give someone early encouragement ultimately what the machine does is he recognizes people's interests so if you post something that's not interesting though a lot of people even if you gave it a lot of exposure you're not going to get of morality that you what whereas come so is is a lot of you know there's no
there's no push your you know it's not like you can go and push something and because i like chris huhne on going to push your content and doesn't work like that you got to have a message to residents are people and if it does then he will automatically just have to borrow the itself that's the beauty of user generated content it's is not something that can be engineered oh
over thought it'd be really is something the has to resonate with the audience and if it does then he goes viral know speaking privately with with investor who knows your company quite quite well
who who said that actually the that the the level of sophistication of the algorithms you have going is is just another order of magnitude to up competitors like you know facebook
