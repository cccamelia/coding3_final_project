the case that when we're feeling the most anxious uncomfortable socially awkward versions of ourselves when our hearts are pounding and are palms are sweating and me feel a crawling out of our skin
are we also the most nice and often generic to the people around us
i'm a social psychologists and i've been studying the science of uncomfortable social interactions for over twenty years so everything from new roommate relationships negotiations upward feedback with your boss to doctor patient interactions those moments where you need a break in and say your for the last twenty minutes actually have no idea what you are talking
about can we may be rewind to bed and to study these things i look at three main outcomes first i look at what people say the things we can control how friendly we are how much we complement one another how much we give gracious feedback
second i look at the things that are tougher for us to control our nonverbal behaviors things like fidgeting avoiding eye contact playing with her hair doodling then and even tone of voice and then i look at the things that are impossible for us to control are under the skin responses are physiology
g r cardiovascular reactivity things like blood pressure heart rate he's types of things that we often don't even really realize that we're feeling and the way i do this is by having people commented lab and interact with each other and a bunch of different settings
and i have them negotiate with each other a had them get acquainted with each other and often it's the case the in these interactions people are required to give some form of feedback to their partner tell them honestly whether thinking or feeling common with an offer for negotiation tell them what they could have done better next time
and i think we all can you know what it feels like to be him when he studies you might not know what it would really feel like to be in one of my studies there's a lot of equipment involved and but we plug people are tall of these things to measure these under the skin response as be video tape them to capture those behaviors that i just mentioned not a get us all into this mindset of what it's like to feel awkward
maybe potentially little bit nice and want you want to think about what was the last awkward interaction the you had a so keep this thought in your mind you can think about it for a few moments
because in a couple minutes i'm actually gonna randomly call on someone based on your seats to have you come up and share your story of what that moment felt like
so before we do that i just want you all to kind of get a sense of the typical pattern that we see when people are engaging in these interactions so we bring them into the lab we hook them up to all this equipment and within moments within the first twenty seconds we start to see those stress responses that i mentioned the heart rate goes
up their blood pressure increases it doesn't take much to get people to start to feel anxious next we see it and those nonverbal behaviors they start to fidget they avoid eye contact they pull their chair a couple inches away from the person who's sitting next to them in an just to get a little bit more distance
one of my favorite findings isn't doctor patient interactions uncomfortable doctors they look down at the chart more are they look more at the computer screen instead of making eye contact with his patients
so let's all return to your awkward moment is everyone have an awkward moment in mind when thinking about when
how many of you have i increases in your heart rate maybe palms are sweating you can start to feel yourself getting a little tingly just the mere thought of being called upon today
ag a few of you may be what are seeks be excited about that opportunity not and okay same people could pick
how many of you if i did call on you would walk up here you would grant through gritty greeted t like this and you would do it even though you secretly hated me the whole time
a few the of door am not going to actually do this and this was all just a ruse to teach a lesson which is in uncomfortable social interactions we often don't have a social script of what to do instead of telling people what we really think what we really feel we do the nice thing that makes us incredibly uncomfortable
no one of my favorite findings illustrating this effect is in the context of negotiations i went to a major from and i brought people together who are used to working with one another
and we had him engage in a negotiation and at the end of it there was a winner in there was a loser
so he said to the winner you know this is really a study about feedback and what we would like you to do is give some constructive feedback to the person who just lost what are some things that they could do better next time what are some potential miss stops how many of you think that that's what they actually did they really followed are instructions
hey nobody can see where this is going
what we found is that even when we're talking to someone who just lost a negotiation to as we tend to bend over backwards we say things like the way you me that really early offer and didn't even ask for counter i was amazing or it was so great how you didn't even ask me anything about my side or what i was willing to kind of you know change
on a or be flexible on people layered on the compliments to someone who they just beat in a negotiation telling him how great they are
so often these kinds of interactions the take the form of what i'll call anxious niceness and they involve lot of compliments telling people what they do well in a very general non specific way
but a lot of work actually looks at what's what's it like to be on the receiving end of these types of interactions how do you feel when you interact with someone over and over again who's giving off these kinds of riddles smiles these are typically the kinds of facial expressions that we actually see from people kind of sneering
a little bit aside i you know arms crossed these types of things after a lifetime of interacting with someone who engages in anxious niceness what we find is that most people on the receiving end or racial minorities they disadvantage disadvantaged group members they are the type of people that we are worried about appearing prejudice in front of
and that anxiety is regulated by being over the top nice to these folks
we also find that these individuals tend to be more synchronize to and attentive to the how we say a peace than the what we say part someone once teddy we had black and white americans interact with each other in across race interaction and we brought them into the lab and we measure the physiology of both partners
what this allowed us to do is captured the degree to which people stress those under the skin responses can actually be caught by their partners
and what we expect to define is that the black participants will become more synchronize physiologically to those whites the be more attuned to those kind of nonverbal signals of anxiety and that's exactly what we found the more anxious those white participants appeared for the fidgeted the more they avoided eye contact even the higher their cortisol sorry
activity indicating some real deep and of under the skin stress response the more those by participants became linked up to them over time
and i think this finding is a little bit terrifying i think it means that we often think of our own stress in our own physiology as independent of the people we interact with but our bodies are not always or owner physiology is not always around and if you spend a lifetime interacting with people who are so nice to you in an effort to control their anxiety you could potentially catch that stress a good
negatively affect your body's
no often what we find is the type of feedback the people are actually getting isn't always super direct sometimes it's a little bit patronizing so you could probably see where i'm going with as having over the top positive nice feedback can harm your performance you make it very difficult for you to climb up difficulty kind of know where you stand what you should do better with you
need to stop doing but can also damage people in ways that we often don't think about it can affect their reputations outside of the interaction context
so imagine the case that you're one of these people who loves giving this general nice feedback and you have someone who works for you and a recruiter calls me be passed employee recruiter cause you or someone asks you for a letter of recommendation the kinds of things are going to put are gonna be like there are real team player they have great energy at work generic things
yes there are nice but they are not very telling about what that person is really like and what we find is that the readers of these things at best think to themselves while they must not really know this person at all or even know what this means at worst they think to themselves where they probably have some real opinions they're just afraid to share them so these kinds of general positive fee
back kinda actually harm people's reputation when they're not backed up with real data
so i think we have didn't think about what is the solution to this problem is is the case that we should all just be meaner to each other in an effort to be more direct i don't think that's the case at all i think there are some things we can do and i'm in a highly three of them to improve the degree to which we get clear consistent feedback to people particularly in the workplace
so first we need to ask ourselves the question how many people are on board with his niceness culture really there's a bit of a plural ignorance the goes on when we think about how nice we are to people at work am what i've found is that for every one person who loves this kind of general generic nice feedback
there's another person who feels like it's lazy you feel like it's not helpful and i actually learned this lesson the hard way from one of my students recently she was giving our practice talk in my lab and she spent weeks and weeks preparing it on
