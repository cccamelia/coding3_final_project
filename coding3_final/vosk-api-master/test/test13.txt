then it seems like it should be
actually feeling alive
and when i mean by that is that we all constantly doing release were constantly scrolling
but we're not necessarily living you know we keep ourselves busy to the point of exhaustion or were also languishing in feel a little bit that inside
i think we know that on some level i think that's part of the reason we keep ourselves so busy and distracted to begin with but we don't know what to do about it
so i am here to tell you i figured out what to do about it
we need to have more fun
so you might think that you're already having plenty of fun and that's because in our everyday speech we often use the word fun to describe anything we do have our leisure time even if it's not actually enjoyable and in fact a waste of time servers
so for example we scroll through social media for fun even though doing so often makes us feel bad about like kind of everything or will say there was so fun we should do that again soon and respect
in response to things they worried that fun and that we don't want to do again
ever
but it's not really our father were a little bit sloppy about how we use the word fun because even the dictionary doesn't get a quite right you know it says that fine as an amusement or enjoyment or light hearted pleasure it's a me for kids to have him play areas it makes it sound like it's frivolous and optional
but if you think back on your own memories that stand out to you as having truly been fine and i really encourage you to do this year the memories that you would describe as and forgive me for i scientific terminology so fun
you're going to notice that there's something much deeper going on
i've collected thousands of these stories from people all around the world and i can tell you it's amazing because when people were count the memories in which they had the most fun
they tell you about some of the most joyful and treasured memories of their lives
so in reality fun is not just light hearted pleasure
it's not just for kids and it is definitely not frivolous instead fun as the secrets of feeling alive
so today i want to propose to a new more precise definition of what fun is i want to reveal some of the ways in which it is astonishingly good for us
and want to give you all some suggestions for things you can do starting right now to experience it's power for yourself
so the first thing we need to start with i am is the fact that fun is a feeling and it's not an activity and it's important because a lotta times when i ask people what's fun though respond with a list of activities that they enjoyed you know the same dancing is fun or scheme as finer i don't know pickle ball is fine
everyone seems to think that pickle ball is fun
and assure people can be fun but we've all had experiences were something's off and an activity that seems like it would be fun doesn't end up feeling fun
and then on the flipside we've had experiences were something that doesn't seem like would be fun at all and the feeling ridiculously fun is an element of serendipity it when people do have fun when they experienced this feeling it's actually very easy to recognize because people who are having fun look like they're being illuminated from within
so for example here's me and my husband having fun together
here's some president's having fun together
here's archbishop desmond tutu and the dalai lama having fun together
actually those to seem like they were very often even constantly
having fun together
and as you can see in these photographs true fun produces this visceral sense of lightness and joy
it's radiant and fact when i asked my daughter when she was about five years old what color fun would be she said sunshine
so what is the sunshine you know what is this feeling that we call fun but when people tell me their stories about fun it's really interesting because the details are all different and often quite mundane but the energy running through them as the same and there are three factors that are consistently present to the point that i believe they constitute a new definition one that is a lot more
accurate than what's in the dictionary and those three factors are playfulness connection and flow
so by playfulness i do not mean you have to play games or god forbid make believe i just me having a light hearted attitude of doing things for the sake of doing them and not carrying too much about the outcome letting go of perfectionism when we have fun or guard is down and we're not taking ourselves too seriously
connection or for the feeling of having a special shared experience and i do think it's possible in some circumstances to have fun alone and for this feeling of connection to be with yourself or the surroundings are the activity but the majority of stories of people tell me about their peak fond memories another person is involved and that's true even for interviews
it's
and then flow is the state where we are so engaged and focused on whatever we're doing that we can even lose track of time you can think about an athlete little the game or like a musician plane a piece of music it's when we're in the zone
is possible to be in flow and not have fun like if you're arguing but you cannot have fun if you're not in flow
so playful is cash inflow all feel great on their own but when we experience all three at once something magical happens we have fun
and that doesn't just feel good it is good for us and fact fund us so many amazingly good things for us that i personally believe that fun is not just the result of human thriving it's a cause
so for example fun is energizing
when people tell me their stories about fun they glow it is like a fire has been lit inside of them in the energy and the warmth of they give off is contagious
you know so much of life drains us but fun fills us up
fun also makes us present a lot of us put a lotta work and a trying to be more present you know we do yoga classes we meditate and that is all great or the fact that fun as a flow state means that when we're having fun we simply are present there's no other way for to happen
fun also unites us we live in a really polar as worlds and as we whole know there's a lot of very serious problems but when we have fun with people we don't see them as different political parties or nationalities are religions reconnect with them as human beings it's worth noting that that is the first step and been able to work together
to solve those problems
fun also makes us healthier now being lonely and stressed out as many of us have been for the past two years causes hormonal changes in our bodies that increase our risks for disease but when we have fun relaxed and were more socially connected both of which have the opposite effect
so kind of blows my mind every time i think about it this way but having fun is a health intervention
and then lastly fun is joyful in it we all so desperately want to be happy we read books about happiness we download apps buy happiness but when we are in a moment of having fun we are happy
so makes me think that perhaps the secret to long term happiness is just to have more everyday moments of fun
so how do we do that how do we have more fun well to start with do not take the suggestions you'll find a magazine articles about how to have more fun so i'll i looked up some of these myself when i found suggestions that include are not is up
roasted turkey
put together an altar to loved ones who have passed
watch a documentary about climates
and my personal favorite a during your table with gourds
so go
those are not good suggestions
instead the most effective thing you can do to have more fun is to focus on it's ingredients are which i mean do everything you can to fill your life with more moments of playfulness connection and flow so here's my ideas for how to do so so to star with reduced distractions and order to increase flow anything that distracts you is going to kick you out to flow and prevent you from having
fun
and what's the number one source of distraction for most of us these days
oh thank you
a for target but yes your phones
now i wrote a book called how to break up with your phone so i have strong feelings about this but i can guarantee you that you're not going to have fun if you're constantly on your phone so today i want to challenge you to keep your phone out of your hand as much as possible so the you can take me up my second suggestion which is to increase connection by interacting more with other human being
in real life
now i know that one of the main reasons were causally on our phones is specifically to avoid having to spend time and interact with other human beings in real life
so i want to assure you that it is worth it and it is not as hard as it might seem so here's how you do it you start by making eye contact with someone like look them in the i don't look like in the middle their forehead where the camera would be on a zoom call or
and you say hello
and if that goes well you can introduce yourself
and if that goes well maybe you can ask a question me
