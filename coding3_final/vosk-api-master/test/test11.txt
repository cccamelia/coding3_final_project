news story of to women or an early in the twentieth century
they lived on different coasts they had different religious backgrounds and they were in different stages of life when each experienced an unwanted pregnancy
sally was newly married at the start of the great depression she and her husband decided they couldn't afford to start a family yet
but abortion was illegal in new york city and so she traveled to porto rico to get an illegal abortion
dorothy had recently graduated from high school when she became pregnant by a much older golf instructor her conservative parents shunned her and she had to go away to salvation army home for unwed mothers where she gave birth and place a child for adoption
these women were my grandmother's and their part of the reason i became a demographer and professor studying the causes and consequences of unintended pregnancy
for years people have alleged that abortion harms women the idea that abortion causes mental health harm in particular has been used to justify laws that ban abortion or train dissuade people from choosing it this came to a head in two thousand and seven when supreme court justice and
funny kennedy allowed restrictions on abortion to stand because as he said
while we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon it seems unexceptionable to conclude that some women come to get their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained severe depression and loss of esteem can follow
no reliable data those are words a demographer lives for
we began data collection the very next year
to study the outcomes for people get abortions you need a comparison group ideally people who want an abortion can't get them because they would be in exactly the same circumstances but one group gets the abortion and the other group doesn't my research team at the university of
california san francisco went to thirty abortion facilities across the country each one selected because it was distant enough from other clinics that if someone were to far along in pregnancy for that clinic there was very few other places they could go at each site we focused on recruiting
two groups of people women who were just under the limit and got their abortions and women who showed up a little bit too late and pregnancy and were turned away
i called it the turn away study and the study design was a success in analyzing the data we see those two groups where the same at the start women who received and women who were denied abortions had similar mental health physical health and socio economic well being at the time they saw and a boy
portion we followed almost a thousand women calling them every six months for five years using scientifically validated questions to measure their physical health their mental health and their families well being and we can see that although they started the same those two groups their lives
diverged in ways that could be directly attributed to whether they got their abortion or were turned away
and it didn't work out the way that kennedy had unexceptionable he concluded
in fact we found no mental health harm from abortion and stead we saw higher anxiety lower self esteem lower life satisfaction for the people who are denied the abortion
but this difference didn't last over time the two groups looked the same not because both groups were doing poorly in terms of mental health in fact symptoms of depression and anxiety improved for both groups over time
but the two groups diverged and other important way it's we find worse physical health for women who carry the pregnancy to term and gave birth consistent with a vast medical literature we see that childbirth is associated with greater risk and abortion including hemorrhage
the eclampsia and even death
and the differences in physical health don't end at the time of childbirth for years later we saw higher chronic pain more hypertension and overall worse physical health for women who were denied the abortion and gave birth we also fine large socio economic differences
where women who are denied abortions face more hardships than women who receive abortions
we find an increase in public assistance but it's not enough to make up for a loss of full time employment
women often raising children alone end up falling below the federal poverty level
working with economists i was able to show that those who received and those who were denied abortions or similar economically for years before the year of the unwanted pregnancy but for years after we see more debt lower credit scores and a greater chance of eviction and bankruptcy for people who were
turned away
and one other area of difference i'll mention we see differences in the chance that women set and achieve aspiration or plans for their future this includes things like breaking ties with abusive partners finding high quality romantic relationships getting
advanced educational degrees
financially supporting their older children and even differences in the chance of having an intended pregnancy later
the results of my study consistently show that when there is a difference those who are able to get their wanted abortion did better than those who weren't
this may come as a surprise to people who don't think about why women get abortions women often give many reasons housing and financial circumstances their relationship with the man involved in the pregnancy their need to take care of existing children more than half of those seeking abortions
it's nationally are already parenting at least one child
all of the areas women were concerned about finances children and relationships life aspirations where the areas in which we see differences
in the experiences of those denied abortions we see all their concerns playing out exactly as they anticipated when they were deciding whether to have an abortion
their concerns were justified
over the five years we follow them we see that over ninety five percent of those who received their abortion said it was the right decision for them
very few of those people who gave birth decided to place a child for adoption less than ten percent so there is another example of a supreme court justice making an assumption that turned out to be wrong
may remember any coney barrett in deliberating on ending fifty years were portion rights and our country's suggested that women could drop their babies off at fire stations
we find that once people have taken the risk and need the monumental sacrifice of giving birth to a child most people decide to parent that child adoption is not an easy choice and in fact the women who plays children for adoption
where the most likely to say that they were having difficulty coping with their experience
it's not news to me that some people think abortion is wrong but when someone's in this circumstance where they are pregnant and they cannot support a child and take care of their existing children
or make a decent life for themselves they're trying to make a decision that is right for their life and their family
as the abortion provider doctor george tiller used to say before his murder in two thousand nine trust women
access to safe legal abortion is important for all of us unintended pregnancy is very common in my family in all of our families across our country in red states and lose
dates and across the globe
i've worked with scientists in tunisia columbia south africa bangladesh nepal to study the experiences of people who are pregnant when they aren't ready and we see these same concerns about wanting to have children under the right circles
