so
i'm from guatemala
this is a public service announcement that is where one of my last
also that is not where they keep the prisoners and is called one time animal
the same place
so what i'm most right below mexico and for the americans in the audience and let the sink in because it really applies in most ways for the americans in the audience you can think of it as mexico's mexico
just like the us doesn't one illegal immigration from mexico mexico doesn't want to illegal immigration from guatemala
it's a smaller country
it's a poor country
and well what can i tell you how much better mexican food
what am i was it's a very poor country and a lot of people talk about education or something that brings equality to different social classes but i always it has the opposite some them brings inequality
because what happens in practice is that people who have a lot of money and by themselves a really good education and therefore continue having a lot of money whereas people who don't have very much money and they learn how to read and write and therefore never make a lot of money and this is especially true in poor countries
now i was fortunate that i received a rich person's education
even though i didn't grow up rich and it's because i'm an only child
and my mother who was a single mothers and all of our resources on my education
and this allow me to come to college to the u s and eventually get a phd in computer science
now because of all of us
about ten years ago i decided i wanted to do something that would give equal access to education to everyone
and by the way this is what i want to talk to about three given equal access to education to everyone
at the time i was a professor of computer science at carnegie mellon university and i decided to work on this with my phd student summary
the way my brain works olive education is just too general have a problem
so i decided let's start teaching one thing and then i started thinking okay well what should we teach first to teach math mean we both loved math me and my cofounder we both have math and now we we didn't decide to do math then we fighting and well maybe you should teach computer science
but eventually and this may be surprising that people in north america eventually we decided that the best subject to start with was teaching foreign languages
and let me tell you why is a number of reasons i'm one of them is that there's a huge audience for it is a two billion people in the world earning a foreign language of in school and outside of schools most of these people went away i learning english about eighty percent of them are learning english and this weird map i hear all the countries in green a countries in which people are pretty
dominantly learning english and the reason for that is because english control the transform your life in most countries in the world knowledge of english and significantly increase your income potential
so this is another reason why we decided to start with foreign languages and is because you can directly make more money if you'll learn another language in particular english and see this is pretty different than many other subjects for example big math
because of math just knowledge of math does not increase your income potential because usually you have to learn math to then learn physics to them become a civil engineer like that's how you make more money whereas with languages if you are a waiter and you'll learn english now you can be a waiter at a hotel and make more money
so we decided well let's get started teaching languages now we also convinced ourselves that the only way to really reach a lot of people west are using a mobile phone or smartphone in particular
the building schools all over the world is simply too expensive
on the other hand most of the world's population already has access to a smartphone and the trend is that a fraction is only going to increase so we decided that the time that we would make a way to learn foreign languages on a mobile phone that was accessible to everyone and then we call it duolingo
now in order to truly be accessible to everyone rich and poor duolingo used as a freemium model to support itself
that means is that you can learn as much as you want without ever having to pay
but if you don't pay you may have to see an ad at the end of a lesson
and if you don't like ads you can also paid to describe the turn of the ads
and it turns out that the vast majority of the revenue for duolingo comes from people to pay described to turn of the ass
and now for these people who pay to suspend the turn of the as well they're usually people that well off people in rich countries like the us and canada who are the people who don't pay does as by be usually come from poorer countries like brazil or vietnam or one ammo
what i like about this model is that it is a small form of wealth redistribution because we're basically a rich people to pay for the occasion education of everyone so i like that
it's a great so with smartphones we can reach a lot of people and we can even get the rich people to pay for the whole thing spread however if you're trying to deliver education with a smartphone you run into a humongous problem
and it is that smartphones comic but with some of the most i forgive drugs to humanity has engineered it doctor instagram mobile games
seat delivering education of our smartphone is like hoping that people will eat your broccoli or right next to it you put the most delicious dessert ever made
if if you really want to deliver education to everyone not only do you have to make it accessible but also you have to make it so that people want to actually learn
and we do willing we've been able to do this and at the highest level the where we've done this is by making the broccoli there's like desert
i say it another way what we've done is that we've used the same psychological techniques that
apps like instagram up or mobile games used to keep people engaged in this case we use them to keep you engaged with education
and even some examples of these techniques one of the most powerful ones is the notion of a streak what a streak is is is just a counter measures a number of days that you've used the proud of consecutive you just think that number you put a very prominently in your product and then people come back every day and the reason people come back every day is because
well if they don't come back that number reset to zero and people don't want to lose district
it works
now on the one side streets have been criticised for for example getting teens addicted to snap chat but in the case of an educational map
three get people to come back to study everyday
not to give you an idea of the power of streaks in the case of duolingo we have over three million daily active users and have a streak longer than three hundred and sixty five
that means they haven't missed the day in the last year or longer now on fact about streaks one country to getting has the longest average streets
for an educational app
it's pam
of course
shortest that restricts
latin america maybe
oh what fun a were fun
another important mechanism to get people to come back to your product or notifications on the ones i notifications can be released on the and annoying but in the case of an educational product you will actually want to be reminded to learn and because of duolingo we have a very sophisticated ai system
that basically choose this when to send the notification and also what to say in his notification to maximize the probability that people come back
now interestingly even after all the sophistication it turns out that the algorithm for choosing what i'm to send your notification is pretty simple
you know what is the best time to send people a notification i'll tell you it's twenty four hours after they use the brought up last
because and there's an easy explanation if you are free yesterday at three pm you probably street today after be i'm as well
and so this is what a very sophisticated millions of dollars of a i found
funny
now with notifications you shouldn't be spam and we're not spamming with duolingo actually stop sending notifications after seven days of and activities of you don't use duolingo for seven days we stopped and the you notifications not some point it occurred to us if we're stopping the send people don't have a good as we should let them know so i we started sending this notification two people saying it is a reminder
seem to be working with stop sending them for now you know people do when they get this notification
they come back
passive aggressive
worst for my mother works for developing a
passive aggressive not i guess it's a really good up getting people to come back because they feel like are green our mascot has given up on them
so they come back and speaking of a green our mascot by the way because all our notifications come from our green our mascot and well his passive aggressive and also pretty bushy this is given rise to a lot of names on the internet that make fun of just the great lengths that he will go through get you back to learn a language is one of my favorite ones this is it's a meme my favorite ones
basically looks like you forgot your spanish lessons and then there's an intruder lend presumably the al broke into your house to give you learn language
now duolingo has entered the decide guest and this this thousands of means there's some else gets about it and it's because we've managed to get people to want to learn a language by using the same techniques that
mobile games and social media use to get people engaged and
this is a really important point let me say this am
i don't actually believe that there's a way to make an educational app yes engaging something like picked up where instagram or mobile games
but the good news is that and by the way to the reason i don't believe that is because ultimately you have to teach people something and it's hard to compete with like cats and celebrities i'm but the good news is the i don't think you have to so here's the thing when you're learning something you get meaning out of it whereas when you're scrolling for two hours and instagram a lot of times afterwards if
you're lucky you just wasted your time so i think it's actually okay if your educational product is only eighty or ninety percent as engaging or something like ticked off because the other ten or twenty percent will be provided by people's internal motivational though of course not much more than that
this is really a key point if we want to get people to do something
meaningful you can use the same techniques that apps like social media use to get people to do it and even if you're not as engaging as those apps are you can still get hundreds of millions of people to use your product in the case of duolingo for example there are more people learning languages on duolingo in the united states and there are people learning languages across all us high school
combined
and this is true in most countries in the
